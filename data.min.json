Activities, as the name implies, are Apps that involve active engagement from the learner. Activities automatically save results to a journal, where reflections are recorded. Activity instances can be shared between learners; many support real-time collaboration. Sugar collaboration works \"peer to peer,\" in a classroom or under a tree; Sugar does not require the Internet.\n\nThe Sugar Journal records everything a learner does using Sugar. There is no need to remember to click a Save Button. The focus is on the activity, not the computer. The Journal is also a place for reflection, where learners and their teachers can monitor progress.\n\nA subset of the Sugar platform is also available as an Android app and in a web browser.","tags":["learning","reflection","collaboration"],"twitter_url":null,"contact_email":"walter@sugarlabs.org","irc_channel":"https://chat.sugarlabs.org","slug":"sugar-labs","preferred_contact_method":null,"guide_to_working":"There is more detail regarding all tasks here: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Google_Code_In_2017/background","name":"Sugar Labs","precis":"At Sugar Labs, we make a collection of tools that learners use to explore, discover, create, and reflect.","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/FQ6qikxCNsIsiiWrF1TUZ8yhpJNKRF9aNJLQmBpolGfm5VG1Q3mdBkHv6VQm0L0-rS1nqpN63bmzCeY6l9xi4w","blog_url":null,"github":"sugarlabs","chat":{"url":"https://chat.sugarlabs.org","platform":"OTHER","image":"static/images/chat.png"}},{"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","leaders":[{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Abishek V Ashok","id":6198775896866816,"github_account":"abishekvashok"},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Aditya Dutt","id":4556923112259584},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Kartikeya Singh","id":5689414720159744},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Kuba Michalski","id":5361327000256512},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Naveen Rajan","id":5635654950060032},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Phúc Ngô","id":5199904546750464},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Saarthak Chaturvedi","id":4572716310986752},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Samyak Jain","id":5596372331921408},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Supun_TE","id":6598335160909824},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Yash Kumar Verma","id":4707728943480832}],"accepted_org_tos":true,"dev_mailing_list":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/u/0/108920596016838318216","programming_languages":["java","javascript","android","web technologies","python"],"guide_to_working_url":"https://blog.fossasia.org/open-source-developer-guide-and-best-practices-at-fossasia/","completed_task_instance_count":320,"id":6237166344601600,"winners":{},"mailing_list":"http://groups.google.com/group/fossasia","website_url":"https://fossasia.org","status":2,"program_year":2017,"description":"FOSSASIA develops Open Source software and hardware for conversational AIs, science and event management with a global developer community from its base in Asia.

The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\n The software tools, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and the various [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, hoping this will allow a broader audience to benefit from our work.","tags":["networking","web","wifi","mesh","iot"],"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openwisp","contact_email":null,"irc_channel":"http://openwisp.org/support.html","slug":"openwisp","preferred_contact_method":null,"guide_to_working":"Must read pages:\n\n- [How to run a successful GCI and become an OpenWISP star](http://openwisp.io/docs/developer/google-code-in.html)\n- [Guidelines for contributing to OpenWISP](http://openwisp.io/docs/developer/contributing.html)\n\nDon't forget to [join the our live chat and mailing list](http://openwisp.org/support.html) to ask questions.","name":"OpenWISP","precis":"OpenWISP is an open source solution designed to build and manage low cost networks: from public wifi, to university wifi, mesh networks and IoT and much more.","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Df4vqOzYseDWiInoUvC-4jjXTjJVUBAGib9FqQdyHJGb00mHFWOqeZt8NmiM-hyouN2LCz14Q7XDtn3U9ylClBI","blog_url":null,"github":"openwisp","chat":{"url":"http://openwisp.org/support.html","platform":"OTHER","image":"static/images/chat.png"}},{"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","leaders":[{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Alex O'Brien","id":6267144998223872},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Bach Nguyen","id":5407628760973312},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Damillora","id":5679153909071872,"github_account":"Damillora"},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Han Haoxuan","id":6025453900922880},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Leorize","id":6702015805652992},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Mochammad Nur Afandi","id":5177112698814464},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Ng Young Shung","id":5162635370692608},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Owen","id":6035804772106240}],"accepted_org_tos":true,"dev_mailing_list":null,"gplus_url":null,"programming_languages":["c","c++","python","bash","html"],"guide_to_working_url":"https://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/GoogleCodeInTaskDetails","completed_task_instance_count":175,"id":6281461650948096,"winners":{},"mailing_list":"https://www.haiku-os.org/community/ml","website_url":"https://www.haiku-os.org/","status":2,"program_year":2017,"description":"Haiku is named after the classical three-line Japanese poetry form.

It even excludes such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release, and fully replaceable.\n\n# Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability. Other JVM languages can be added too.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single console command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.","tags":["game","voxel","minecraft","sandbox","modding"],"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/Terasology","contact_email":"terasology@gmail.com","irc_channel":"https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Using-IRC","slug":"movingblocks","preferred_contact_method":null,"guide_to_working":"","name":"MovingBlocks","precis":"Terasology: like an open source Minecraft - imagine the possibilities!","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/xXnPqLkLDZYuz6XBxkKKTcaRWcsgzLcMgLx21ADAAIv2BAtRIyk9lI0ryrEBhh7K3r6YXdJOHAHu5hl9e2iNQ-Rn","blog_url":"http://forum.terasology.org","github":"MovingBlocks","chat":{"url":"https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Using-IRC","platform":"IRC","image":"static/images/logos/irc.png"}},{"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)","leaders":[{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Alejandro Heredia","id":5243643889713152},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Chandra Chou","id":6189747405848576},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"headhunter","id":5126869030535168},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Nikita Kotenev","id":6003849812770816},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Sarthak Agrawal","id":5394417575788544},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Siddh Jain","id":6267827092717568},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Yudhistira G.S.","id":4611923993690112},{"program_year":2017,"display_name":"Łukasz Ameljan","id":5096542534893568}],"accepted_org_tos":true,"dev_mailing_list":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/communities/116816272940643231129","programming_languages":["visual programming language (catrobat)"],"guide_to_working_url":"http://catrob.at/cgcicti","completed_task_instance_count":126,"id":5135243763777536,"winners":{},"mailing_list":"http://catrob.at/PocketCodeUserForum","website_url":"https://www.catrobat.org/","status":2,"program_year":2017,"description":"If you know how to code with Scratch, including its straightforward visual coding blocks and seamless multi-threading features allowing to program in your mother tongue, then its little sister project Catrobat will feel immediately familiar.
