This concept described how heterosexuality is assumed, enforced and viewed as an obligation regardless of one’s own sexual preferences, and it was the subject of one of the articles that members of the <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_LGBT%2B/Portal\">LGBT user group</a> wrote about in different languages in Stockholm, Sweden, last August.</p>\n<p>The event was organized by a group of Wikimedians coming from Asia, Africa, and Europe, all united by one single cause: promoting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT\">LGBT</a> Culture and achievements online. For four days in August, 12 participants took part in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europride\">EuroPride</a> 2018 in Stockholm. In two days of editing, the participants created, translated, and improved over 80 LGBT-related Wikipedia articles in more than 10 languages, in addition to adding over 300 photos. They also participated in a human rights summit, and the user group walked in a pride parade for the first time. For some participants, it was the first time they had the chance to walk in a pride parade in their life, as they don&#8217;t exist in their home countries.</p>\n<p>The meeting gave LGBT user group members the opportunity to meet and exchange their personal experiences both inside and outside the Wikimedia movement. They also strategized about how they could support one another through an international network. Next year, two similar events will be organized in Vienna for EuroPride and New York for World Pride.</p>\n<p>We talked with two organizers of the Stockholm event: Houssem Abida and Saskia Ehlers. If you&#8217;d like to contribute to making the flag more visible on Wikipedia, join the <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_Loves_Pride\">Wiki Loves Pride</a> initiative.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s the current state of LGBT content on Wikipedia? Where is it strong, and where is it weak?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Houssem Abida</strong>: I think LGBT content needs a lot of work on Wikipedia, especially in some specific languages. For example, you can find articles that cover almost all sexual concepts in English, but it is very hard to find them in Arabic. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_king\">drag kings</a> are a very basic concept in LGBT culture, but they didn&#8217;t exist on the Arabic Wikipedia before the Stockholm edit-a-thon.</p>\n<p>Also, many important activists are still not showcased enough through the platform; it is our role to write about them.</p>\n<p>That said, I think a strong point of Wikipedia is that it gives a relatively good and updated general overview of the situation LGBT people are living in every country (through the articles &#8220;LGBT in X&#8221;).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong>How does the emerging <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017\">Wikimedia 2030</a> strategy fit with improving coverage of LGBT topics on Wikipedia?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Houssem Abida: </strong>I think the strategy is very supportive to our case and in fighting for it. For example, the way it emphasizes partnerships is very important for us and makes our work stronger and structured (NGOs provide references and documents, help with logistics, help us access difficult communities, etc.). Also, focusing on local communities is something we need, as it provides us with deeper communication channels and allows to reach a bigger and more vulnerable community (when it comes for the sexual education role that Wikipedia plays, for example).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong>What gave you the idea to combine EuroPride with peace advocacy?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Saskia Ehlers: </strong>This is a somewhat longer story. My grandparents met through a peace organization after World War II. They took part in workcamps where they rebuilt churches and houses with teams of young people from different countries that had previously been at war. The intention of those kinds of exchanges and organizations was for the participants to get to know each other&#8217;s cultures and become friends, so that it would in the future it would not be possible to blindly hate and slaughter people just because they had another nationality, culture, or spoke another language.</p>\n<p>When the time came I became active in such an organization as well. I was a camp leader and organizer in Germany and other countries. Through that I met Thomas Schallhart from Austria, who was like me active within the Wikimedia movement and the same peace organization. We decided to combine both passions in the <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/07/13/digest-wikipedia-for-peace/\">Wikipedia for Peace</a> project. In this, young people from different countries came together to write about a certain peace related topic on Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>I had organized a <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_for_Peace_Madrid_World_Pride\">LGBT-related Wikimedia event in Madrid in 2017</a> because the World Pride took place there then. It was truly great and very fruitful, so I wanted to repeat this in Stockholm—and as Thomas had lived in Sweden for several years, we had the necessary connections to make that idea a reality.</p>\n<p>The reason why we see writing about LGBT issues as a topic suitable for the Wikipedia for Peace format is that aside from nationality, culture, and language barriers, people are also excluded or hated because of their sexual preferences. Both Thomas and I have experienced that personally. This format gives us the chance to spread knowledge in different language versions, and through education create tolerance and awareness. In Madrid, for example, participants wrote the first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyz_language\">Kyrgysz</a> Wikipedia article on sexual diversity. On the other hand people can have human exchanges and gain understanding through this. One thing that I can think about here is how one person in Madrid described how and why they had bullied homosexuals in their youth, and how the phenomenon is very present in their culture until today. That same person continued to work on the topic after the event was finished. I think that these events and sharing experiences with very different people can change a person&#8217;s mind and life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong>How did you decide what topics to cover at the Stockholm edit-a-thon?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Saskia Ehlers: </strong>People had different ideas on what to write about, so at the end we covered a wide variety of topics. One person for example promised to their bisexual friend that they would write about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphobia\">biphobia</a> in their language as there is sometimes discrimination within the LGBT community towards bisexuals. Another person who is a doctor in real life wrote about sex change surgery. We had a reflection round each day and talked about what each person wrote about during the day. So people also gave each other ideas and influenced each other on what to write about. We also had input in terms of talks from participants. In one talk different gender concepts from all over the world were mentioned, which led one participant to write about the Southern Mexican concept for the third gender Muxe. We took part in the human rights summit in which important activists and speakers from different countries were present. One of them was Sedef Çakmak who was the first openly gay politician to be elected into office in Turkey. Some people wrote about her in their language versions. We also took a picture of her at the summit, which is now included in her article.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong>Have you run into any difficulties? If so, what?</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s somewhat difficult to finance and organize such international exchanges through Wikimedia funds. Conference grants don&#8217;t really fit because the projects are designed to be low budget. Travel costs can only be reimbursed from chapters with a lot of money for community support, such as Germany, Switzerland or Austria. All of means that it is a lot harder for people from poorer countries or regions with no user groups or chapters to participate. This made the financing and logistics somewhat difficult and time consuming. A rapid grant alone is not sufficient to cover the flights, accommodation, and food costs during the event. Another kind grant to organize such exchanges like a European fund would be great. We proposed this idea at Wikimania in Cape Town.</p>\n<p>Aside from that we&#8217;d like to thank the Austrian, German and Swedish chapter for the financial and in kind support of the event.</p>\n<p><em>As told to Ed Erhart, Senior Editorial Associate, Communications</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>This interview has been minimally edited.</em></p>\n","published":"2018-11-09T17:41:38.000Z","author":"Saskia Ehlers, Houssem Abida and Ed Erhart","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/11/09/europride-stockholm/","feed":{"source":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/feed/","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org","name":"Wikimedia Foundation"}},{"title":"FAW 2018 Day 5: “Encouraging crazy ideas”","content":"<img width=\"766\" height=\"324\" src=\"https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fedora-appreciation-week-766x324.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Fedora Appreciation Week (FAW)\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fedora-appreciation-week-766x324.png 766w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fedora-appreciation-week-300x127.png 300w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fedora-appreciation-week-768x325.png 768w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fedora-appreciation-week-1024x433.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /><p>Today is Day 5 of <a href=\"https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/commops/appreciation-week/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fedora Appreciation Week</a> and the final day of published Contributor Stories.

As someone who was completely new to almost everything, it was tough to get started. After creating my FAS ID back in September 2015, I remained a spectator for the next few months all the while trying to find some ground. At the end of my semester, April 2016, I decided to take action and joined the <a href=\"https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/commops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CommOps group</a> &#8211; my first step towards being a Fedora contributor. I dropped by at one of the meetings and that&#8217;s when I met Justin and Remy. Both of them helped me understand the way CommOps works and I was fortunate enough to get assigned a <a href=\"https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/68\">task</a> at my first meeting itself.  (Thanks Justin and Remy for trusting a complete newbie <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"😊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> ) As it was my first task, Remy was always around to help me and answer all of my newbie questions. </p><p>Over the next couple of years, I worked on quite a few things in CommOps and a couple of tasks in Marketing, all thanks to Justin. He also helped me with an IRC bouncer which I very much rely on for all my communication related to Fedora. He always has this positive energy around him and his zeal to always do more for the community really inspires me. We, in CommOps, always joke around about Justin having minions to help out with all his tasks because he is always ahead of everyone in the team. He is the kind of person who&#8217;ll always stay true to the <a href=\"https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;Friends&#8221; foundation</a>. The kind of person you can look up to and feel free to ask for any kind of help.</p><p>If I were to wish for something, I&#8217;d wish to get as much knowledge as Remy and the same enthusiasm as Justin&#8217;s. Thank you Remy and Justin for everything!&#8221;</p><cite><a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Dhanesh95\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dhanesh Sabane</a>&nbsp;&#8211; <a href=\"https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/contributor-stories/issue/5\">contributor-stories#5</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Fedora-meetup-in-Pune-India.jpg\" alt=\"A spontaneous Fedora Project meet-up in Pune, India.

I had never been in a community, even if sometimes I marginally contributed to some open source projects, mainly in translation or in bug reporting. There were various reasons: my chronic lack of free time, and the fear to be totally unuseful due to the fact that there is so many skilled people inside these projects.</p><p>My first Linux distribution was Red Hat Linux 6, back in 1999. Then Fedora Core, but in the subsequent years I was a so called distro hopper, at least on my laptops. Last year I decided to go back to the origins, and install Fedora again. I was surprised by the clean and ease installation process, compared to the past (and compared to other distros). Looking at the wiki and to other project’s sites, I felt like contributing to the Fedora Project was simple and newcomers were welcome. Then I subscribed to various mailing lists, looking to a place where my little skills could be useful.</p><p>The continuation of the story may appear totally unrelated to Fedora. In fact, in the meanwhile, at work I was involved in a project related to a captive portal for a wifi network, and I needed to send some SMS to foreign phone numbers in order to test the registration page. I’m not an international guy, and I have not friends outside my country (in reality yes, a former colleague that lives in Brazil, but it was unavailable at the time). So, in some messages coming from some Fedora mailing list, at the bottom of the emails of a very active contributor I saw a mobile number. I privately contacted him using Hangout, by telling him my needs. He was so kind that I thought that all the people of the Fedora community might be so collaborative and nice. And in fact I’m still impressed by the commitment of a lot of members in avoiding toxic behavior and how important is to maintain an healthy community.&#8221;</p><cite><a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Alciregi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alessio</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/contributor-stories/issue/6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contributor-stories#6</a></cite></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/faw-2018-day-3-becoming-part-of-fedora-family-because-of-her/\">FAW 2018 Day 3: &#8220;Becoming part of Fedora family because of her!&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org\">Fedora Community Blog</a>.</p>\n","published":"2018-11-07T08:15:07.000Z","author":"Justin W.

Most people will start contributing virtually, in IRC, mailing lists, pull requests, or other ways. For me, my journey into the Fedora community began at Flock 2015 in Rochester, NY. Conveniently, the conference was the week before the day I would move to Rochester to begin my first year of academic studies at a university in Rochester. I decided to move up early and attend because I was a Fedora user and thought it would be interesting to be a part of Flock.</p><p>Flock was amazing and I saw how diverse and large the Fedora community was. People from around the world were here to discuss, plan, and move forward this open source project. One of the things that stood out to me was the conference was more than just hard work and professional context (it was these things too) – but at the end of the day, I could see these people were friends with each other too, and I got to know the Fedora community in a more personal way. One example of this I remember was the Fedora Marketing planning session. There were many intense discussions with many disagreements, but delivered constructively. Then, later that evening, I saw a lot of the same people who were debating intensely either eating together or sharing some drinks, talking like friends that had known each other for years.</p><p>At this time, I was not a contributor. I didn&#8217;t know anyone in the conference. I went alone. I moved into Rochester that week coming from Atlanta, Georgia, so it was a new conference and a new city that was my new home, but it didn&#8217;t feel this way to me yet. There was one point when there was a coffee break and no talks were going on. Many people were talking, but I was quietly off to the side by myself. I didn&#8217;t know who he was at the time, but Pete Travis approached me and started a friendly conversation, about who I was, why I decided to come to Flock, and some of my interests.</p><p>We talked about a few things, but I remember nerding out about a crazy idea of how Fedora could better target a younger audience through gaming. At the time, I was a staff member of one of the largest open source Minecraft server software projects. I saw how so many kids and young adults were exposed to open source and became involved with open source because of Minecraft. I forget what the tie-in to Fedora was, but there was a crazy idea of how Fedora could try to grow and attract those kinds of people as users to the distribution.</p><p>I think the idea was a little pie-in-the-sky, but Pete didn&#8217;t criticize it or shoot it down. He talked with me about it and made me feel like I could be onto something if I developed the idea further. But the important part wasn&#8217;t anything about my crazy idea. In that moment, I started to feel less of an outsider. I started to think of things I could bring to this open source community and project. For the first time, I didn&#8217;t think of myself as an observer, but I realized I could be a participant too, if I made the effort to get involved and participate. I doubt Pete even remembers this, but for me, it was somewhere in that moment where I began to feel a part of this huge community I had spent most of the week just watching.</p><p>Even though I haven&#8217;t seen Pete for a while now, his impact on me starting my journey into Fedora was huge. For the last three years, my adventure and time in Fedora has taken me to all kinds of new places and I have had countless new experiences. And yet, somehow in the last three years of everything that I have seen and has happened to me, I can remember this one simple experience that made a big difference to me.&#8221;</p><cite><a href=\"https://blog.justinwflory.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Justin W.

The internet connection I was using was also not that good and I was worried it would drop off and I would miss a message. I am not sure if I missed any messages but after a few days, Justin reached out and helped me set up my IRC bouncer. I am pretty sure I asked him stupid questions but he didn’t show it and I am glad for that!

She was also the photographer of my wedding.</p><p>At that time (2009) I was working with the Ubuntu Local Community and we were more focused in attend events and some installations. Once at Caracas I met with tatica to help with the organization of the FLISoL and she was the national coordinator. In that FLISoL I was representing Ubuntu and installing Ubuntu and I saw the Fedora stand, they were showing the stuff I usually do in my Ubuntu, but with Fedora, and that let me to think, I can try Fedora again (I knew Fedora Core 3 and 4 before, but I didn&#8217;t found it interesting). After FLISoL, I was a little upset and tire about the Ubuntu Community because I was wanting to do more, more than just events, more than a personal blog, more than just show the distro, but I focused in my job and I started to get away from the community, but still using Linux at a daily basis.</p><p>Getting in touch with people at Caracas and nearby areas, I&#8217;ve attended to a meeting with one of the oldest hardcore communities in Venezuela, I knew several of the guys there, including tatica, in that meeting she invited me to the FUDCon that will be held in Valencia (2012). There I notice something that I never notice before, and it wasn&#8217;t the event or the talks, It was the community itself that took my attention. There I have the chance of talk to several Ambassadors from Latam and to know how their work was actually affecting the distro, not only giving talks, but working in packaging, testing, coding, design, marketing and a lot of areas that actually helps the distro to grow, hand to hand with the community. That year I talked with tatica and told her I want to be part of this and I receive from her an advice that I still carry with me when I&#8217;m going to do something related to the community: &#8220;We are Friends, we have a Free, First and Feature distro to complete our 4 Foundations but the real gasoline that keep this engine going is the commitment. If you want to work with this awesome community be honest, be committed and be humble, that way you will gain trust in the community and things will be great both for you and for Fedora&#8221;. After that year I was going in and out of the community until 2016 when I email her and told I want to be an Ambassador. She IS my mentor, she taught me how this wheel rolls and she still give me advices in times of despair. For that and more, my contributor story is about her.

GNI is a channel for collective action, advocating to governments and international institutions for policies and laws which promote free expression and privacy. As an observer to GNI, the Wikimedia Foundation will be able to benefit from this accomplished network of human rights defenders, and apply the insights we gain to our existing worldwide efforts to advance these two fundamental rights.</p>\n<p>Principle to the Wikimedia movement is the idea of collaboration. Our projects are continually expanded and improved by a global community of volunteers, and we rely on donations from millions of people worldwide to continue operating year after year. Thus, when the opportunity arose to join GNI and collaborate with other leaders in both technology and digital rights, it was only natural for the Wikimedia Foundation to engage. Everyone who joins GNI, from large technology companies to civil society groups fighting for human rights online, has indicated their commitment to addressing and solving the most prescient issues in <a href=\"https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/policy-issues/\">GNI’s focus areas</a>. By working with other member organizations and companies to further the rights of internet users worldwide, our participation as an observer in GNI will be just one of many ways we give back to the global community who supports the Wikimedia movement.</p>\n<p>The Wikimedia Foundation understands that the protection and <a href=\"https://policy.wikimedia.org/\">promotion of human rights online</a> is essential to what we do. In order to provide access to knowledge for everyone, we must protect freedom of expression on our projects. In practice, this means we work to keep Wikipedia volunteers free from attempts to <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/05/22/a-letter-to-minister-ahmet-arslan/\">block</a> or censor their writing on Wikipedia or requests to <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/07/20/wikimedia-releases-ninth-transparency-report/\">remove their content</a>. We hope that by participating in GNI, we can share our experiences not only as a large internet platform, but as a mission-driven organization that holds our values firm even in the face of threats. In return, we are sure that the insights we will gain from the combined experience of GNI’s members will help us to better our initiatives to promote free expression for our communities.</p>\n<p>In addition to freedom of expression, GNI and its members believe in respecting user privacy rights, including initiatives to increase <a href=\"https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/policy-issues/surveillance/\">transparency and accountability in government surveillance</a>. We believe that strong privacy rules and opposition to surveillance are a fundamental part of the freedom that allows people to read and contribute to Wikipedia.  The Wikimedia Foundation has taken a clear stance defending our users’ right to privacy by taking part in a<a href=\"https://policy.wikimedia.org/stopsurveillance/\"> lawsuit challenging the NSA’s upstream surveillance collection</a> activities and encrypting all traffic to and from Wikimedia projects through the <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/\">HTTPS protocol</a>. By taking concrete steps to defend user privacy, we are able to offer a unique perspective to other GNI members interested in how to better protect individuals. We hope that the connections we make within GNI will strengthen our own efforts to ensure that people are free to read and write Wikipedia without fear of anyone looking over their shoulder.</p>\n<p>The Wikimedia Foundation reflects our commitment to GNI’s mission in both our actions as the host of Wikipedia and our greater advocacy efforts through the Wikimedia movement. We are excited to collaborate with and learn from the variety of committed organizations and individuals who make up GNI in order to further these efforts to promote freedom of expression and privacy worldwide and ensure that everyone, everywhere can have access to knowledge.</p>\n<p><em>Jan Gerlach, Senior Public Policy Manager</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n","published":"2018-10-29T17:00:21.000Z","author":"Jan Gerlach","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/29/wikimedia-foundation-joins-the-global-network-initiative/","feed":{"source":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/feed/","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org","name":"Wikimedia Foundation"}},{"title":"How could Wikimedia Commons be improved? A conversation with designer George Oates","content":"<p>Earlier this year, the Wikimedia Foundation asked designer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Oates\">George Oates</a>, who has worked for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr\">Flickr</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive\">Internet Archive</a>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Library\">Open Library</a>, among others, to conduct a deep dive into <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/\">Wikimedia Commons</a>, the free media repository that provides many of the images used on Wikipedia. We wanted a fresh pair of eyeballs, and we were particularly interested in Oates’ observations about possible areas of improvement.</p>\n<p>Oates soon realized navigating Wikimedia Commons and finding interesting materials is challenging. She noted how the category system used to organize and tag media files on Commons is confusing and hides—not shows—the richness of content there. Other areas of improvement she mentioned include making both contributors and contributions more prominent and inviting, improving the user experience for new users, and actively recruiting more diverse gender participation in the project. (Oates noted that the group of administrators on Wikimedia Commons is internationally diverse, but not so much in terms of gender; this affects, for instance, the selection of featured images.)</p>\n<p>Oates also identified several ways in which Wikimedia Commons can work more fruitfully with GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums). This is partially due to her background in the field: over the last decade, she as worked on a series of projects that have reimagined how the world engages with the collections of libraries, archives, and museums on the web.</p>\n<p>She created <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/commons\">the Commons on Flickr,</a> which to this day stands as one of the most popular shared platforms for the world’s visual archives. She worked with the Internet Archive to lead the Open Library, a universal and openly editable catalog of the world’s books, connected to a digital lending library. More recently, she has worked with a variety of individual institutions to devise new ways of exploring their collections, like this experimental <a href=\"http://alpha.wellcomelibrary.org/\">interface</a> to the Wellcome Library collection in the UK.</p>\n<p>As we contemplate the future of cultural partnerships and the sharing of open collections in the Wikimedia movement, the Foundation asked George to do a short assignment: look at Wikimedia Commons through the lens of your background and experience, tell us candidly what you see, and suggest areas for improvement. We asked her to focus on the experience of new users, of cultural institutions, and to share with us some ideas of how Commons might evolve in the years ahead. Ben Vershbow (Director of Community Programs) and Sandra Fauconnier (Program Officer for GLAM and Structured Data) sat down with George to speak with her about her findings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ben: Please tell us about yourself!</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George:</strong> I’ve <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgeoates\">worked</a> on the web since 1996, mostly in design-centered roles. I designed a lot of the user interface of the photosharing service, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a>, for the first few years, wrote its <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/help/guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a> (with Heather Champ), and particularly enjoyed creating the privacy and safety tools that helped people coexist. Since 2008, I’ve specialised in the cultural heritage sector, and today, I’m based in London, building an edtech company called <a href=\"http://www.museuminabox.org/\">Museum in a Box</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sandra: What were your first impressions of Wikimedia Commons, looking at it as a &#8216;well-informed newbie&#8217; and with your background of having worked on Flickr, and Flickr Commons?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Turns out, Commons is huge, dense, variegated, and alive.</p>\n<p>It’s a system that’s about the size of Hong Kong (7.3 million people), but it’s only about 14 years old. Hong Kong has been settled for centuries. Just like the city, Commons is full of nooks and crannies, mazes, rules, signs, and people doing their thing.</p>\n<p>Here’s a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4671557223/\">map of Hong Kong</a> drawn using locations where photos were taken. “Blue pictures are by locals. Red pictures are by tourists. Yellow pictures might be by either.”</p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\">\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\">\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\" id=\"attachment_59316\"><div class=\"img-in-text\"><img class=\"wp-image-59316 size-large\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4671557223_c7c11f6d3d_b.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" /></div><div class=\"img-caption\"><span class=\"photo-caption\"></span> <span class=\"photo-credit\"></span></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>For me, this <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/albums/72157624209158632\">Locals and Tourists</a> project symbolises the way people move around software systems. Software can be learned like a place. You can move around it how you see fit, and inhabit corners you like. You can see other people in it, and follow, copy, like, ignore, and meet them.</p>\n<p>This sort of socialising and movement happens on Commons too, but there’s an important difference between Commons, and, say, Facebook, and that’s that <em>the locals are building the city</em>. The ‘old school’ admins know the back alleys and the best noodles, and the Commons newbies head for the tourist hotspots.</p>\n<p>So, in terms of my first impressions, I faced three primary challenges to get to a position where I could present ideas, not just observe:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I am a newbie to the platform, unfamiliar with its rules, rituals and traditions</li>\n<li>There’s a major usability challenge: Information vs Interface</li>\n<li>The rules of engagement are not clear</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But, it also feels important to say that <strong><em>maybe there’s nothing wrong with it</em></strong>. The question in itself reveals a quiet tension. The Wikimedia Foundation’s team who support the Commons is in a hard, interesting position. They’re a crew of professional, philosophically aligned staff who find it difficult to help improve Commons. They meet resistance from the old guard, the community of volunteer admins and other long-term Commons folk who are there every day, have probably been there longer than anyone who works at the Foundation, feel deep ownership of the system, and can exercise deep control. They’ve patiently and visibly negotiated the dynamics of the system for the last fourteen years.</p>\n<p>So, the question becomes <em>what is it OK for the Wikimedia Foundation to do</em>?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ben: Yes, you’ve put your finger on a very delicate aspect of our work. Fortunately, we are finding ways to channel great ideas from the community into well-defined efforts to improve the platform. The prime example right now is our work to integrate Commons more tightly with Wikidata to improve discovery and to offer contributors and partners better ways of describing and organizing content (see </em><a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2017/01/09/sloan-foundation-structured-data/\"><em>here</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data\"><em>here</em></a><em>). </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Before we go deeper into your impressions of Commons, can you say a few words about your design philosophy and how you applied it during this assignment?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George: </strong>There are two main themes in my work that come to bear here:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Challenging the dominance of search as primary digital cultural interface</em></strong></p>\n<p>Many of the web projects I’ve made recently focus on explorability of gigantic cultural collections. I use the prompt “what happens if there’s no search box?” to help you find things. How can you show the shape and contour of a collection to allow people to follow their nose and sniff out the things that interest them?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Importance of copywriting in interface design</em></strong></p>\n<p>Wiki systems are always a battle of <strong>Information vs Interface</strong>. The more functional pages you need to use the thing also take the time to explain and define themselves. It can be so <em>informative</em> it’s overwhelming.</p>\n<p>Wikis are also written by many. At Flickr, I wrote a lot of the interface copy; the “system voice” was largely mine, and therefore, consistent. On Commons, you don’t know who is telling you what. This opacity can be confusing if you’re expected to follow certain rules, but don’t know who’s setting them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ben: So what did you learn as you delved deeper into Commons?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George: </strong>It’s huge and arcane. And successful. “Anyone can contribute” means that all sorts do, and there are now about 50 million things there. That’s astonishing.</p>\n<p>But, there’s very little sense of the scale or depth of the thing. It’s one thing to say there are all those things that anyone can use, but it’s another to show them all. Newbie explorers are confronted with a vast textual category system including an obscure interface element to show contents of each category… can you tell what it means?</p>\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-59317\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Electical-engineering-category-screenshot.png?w=323\" alt=\"\" width=\"323\" height=\"383\" /></div>\n<p><strong><em>Categories are a beautiful disaster</em></strong></p>\n<p>The various Wikipedias work so beautifully because they embrace the networked nature of information. Pages are stronger (and accepted) when they interconnect across the system. Wikipedians joke about getting “lost down the rabbit hole”, where you’re at one place at one minute then you look up an hour later and you’re somewhere completely different. This is because all of the entries are deliberately and delicately interconnected.</p>\n<p>Commons is not like that. Even though there are about 6 million “<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data/About/FAQ\">multi-hierarchichal</a>” categories, the majority of files are only in one category, as this 2017 research shows:</p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\">\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\">\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\" id=\"attachment_59318\"><div class=\"img-in-text\"><img class=\"wp-image-59318 size-large\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SDoC_baseline_-_Number_of_files_by_number_of_categories.png?w=1000\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></div><div class=\"img-caption\"><span class=\"photo-caption\"></span> <span class=\"photo-credit\"></span></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>If you select <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images\">Images</a> at the top of the homepage, you see a list of categories of <em>types</em> of image, not <em>types of things</em> in images. That’s tricky if you’re looking for a photo of a flower and not <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_by_resolution\">Images by Resolution</a>. There are also Topics on the homepage, which operate a little more like you’d expect. You can click on <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mathematics\">Mathematics</a>, then explore <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Chirality_in_mathematics\">Chirality in Mathematics</a> or <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Sets_of_mathematical_objects\">Sets of Mathematical Objects</a>. I was able to find what might be the best category in the history of categories though: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Potato_truncated_from_cube_to_predicate_lattice\">Potato truncated from cube to predicate lattice</a>. <strong>Does that sound like a category to you?</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Showing the actors</strong></em></p>\n<p>I was surprised the thousands of people participating aren’t more obvious. Who’s editing what? Which people like which categories? Who is uploading a lot? Who’s helping other people? I became interested in who the admins were, how/when rules were established, and how decisions are made. If we think in terms of locals and tourists, who are the actors who know what’s happening, who I could ask for advice, or imitate?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Encouraging description</strong></em></p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\">\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\">\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\" id=\"attachment_59319\"><div class=\"img-in-text\"><img class=\"wp-image-59319 size-large\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The_approach_of_the_spirits_.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" /></div><div class=\"img-caption\"><span class=\"photo-caption\"></span> <span class=\"photo-credit\"></span></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When you get to a media file, like this fabulous <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%22The_approach_of_the_spirits%22.png\">The approach of the spirits</a>, there’s nowhere to jump across to; no way to see images like the one you’ve just discovered. Its categories are listed as <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PD-Art_(PD-US-1923)\">PD-Art (PD-US-1923)</a> and <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Illustrations\">Illustrations</a>. Nothing like <em>myth</em>, <em>stories</em>, <em>night</em>, <em>spirits</em>, <em>stars</em>, or <em>the night sky</em>.</p>\n<p>Not being able to move sideways is a huge weakness of any hierarchical structure. It can also be difficult to navigate a hierarchy unless you know its whole structure. You’re constantly going into a branch then back out again, instead of skipping across an interconnected collection. That said, the new work on interconnected Commons infoboxes looks really promising, e.g. <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:St._Paul%27s_Cathedral\">Category:St. Paul’s Cathedral</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s no limit to how many categories a digital object could belong to. How could the system be improved to allow more and different descriptions? As with many traditional cultural collections, an object’s metadata is revisited rarely, so instead of a live database of media like Flickr, where objects enjoy a very social existence, a thinly described object in a sea of 50 million is practically invisible.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Rules of engagement</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>“At the start of my wiki-journey, I was left to fend for myself. It felt akin to being surrounded by hungry beasts and wondering why you&#8217;re still alive&#8230;” –</em><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pyfan\">Pyfan</a></p>\n<p>While it’s also easy or almost trite to say that Wikis are transparent democracies where anyone can participate, I also read quite a lot that people feel really intimidated when they first “come to the party”.  The category structure might also have evolved into what’s there today because the rules of engagement are dense, and the interface when you try to add or enhance things is obtuse.</p>\n<p>As I did my research, I asked a few questions in the IRC channel, or on the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump\">Village Pump</a> (which is really well run, by the way). Answers would be presented, and be useful, but, they referenced pages that I bet would have taken me forever to find, if I could find them at all. They often displayed old “votes” or decisions made by a very few, and not revisited, or with no recourse to revisit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have any tips and direct feedback for the Wikimedia Commons community?</em></strong></p>\n<p>It’s <em>amazing</em>!!</p>\n<p>Like I said, I remain interested in the administration of the thing. In this self-governing system, how are rules created? How do those rules percolate to the newbies? How visible are they? And most importantly, who is making them?</p>\n<p>There are about 225 admins for 7.2 million accounts on Commons. It’s a media library built by 7 million, but not all are editing and adding things all the time. In fact, the Wikimedia Foundation suggests about <a href=\"https://stats.wikimedia.org/v2/#/commons.wikimedia.org/contributing/editors/normal%7Cline%7C2-Year%7C~total\">32,000 folks a month</a> are active, but even so, the system is administered by just 0.00003% of the population.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Diversity in administration / representation / arbitration</em></strong></p>\n<p>I looked into who the Commons admins are, with the data to hand.[1] Here’s a graph that shows <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful_requests_for_adminship\">how many admins were brought on each year</a>, and how many from each year “survived” as admins.</p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\">\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\">\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\" id=\"attachment_59320\"><div class=\"img-in-text\"><img class=\"wp-image-59320 size-large\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Added-and-surviving-admins.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"630\" /></div><div class=\"img-caption\"><span class=\"photo-caption\"></span> <span class=\"photo-credit\"></span></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>I also looked at each admin’s page, and noted whenever I could see a declared gender (using names or photos etc). Here’s the breakdown of admin community demographics:</p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\" id=\"attachment_59322\"><div class=\"img-in-text\"><img class=\"wp-image-59322 size-large\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Admin-community-demographics.png?w=512\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"312\" /></div><div class=\"img-caption\"><span class=\"photo-caption\"></span> <span class=\"photo-credit\"></span></div></div>\n<p>The geographical and language spread of the admins seems pretty good. There are people from different countries, who often also participate in their language Wikipedia and/or the EN Wikipedia, and sometimes even work for, or have worked for, the Foundation. But, even in a best case scenario (where the “unspecified” category from the pie chart was actually about 50/50 women and men, that would still be 66% men and 33% women as declared administrators. There also aren’t many new folks. This might be because the rules of engagement take a while to take in and operate at a sophisticated level. Perhaps it’s also a place to inject diversity, particularly around the things that require some kind of vote or consensus.</p>\n<p>Also interesting to note at this point that Hong Kong has a police force of 34,000.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fostering diversity</em></strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://seejane.org/about-us/\">Geena Davis Research Institute</a> was founded in 2004 to study and shift the balance of representation of women and girls in media. Their tagline is “<em>if she can see it, she can be it</em>,” and the institute has done groundbreaking research about how to measure the presence of women and men in films, mostly, to demonstrate the presence of unconscious bias in our media. The stats are telling.</p>\n<p>One of the very simple ways the institute suggests to check when you’re making a movie is that all the crowd scenes contain 50/50 women and men. I really like this. It’s easy to check and simple to do. If we apply this idea to Commons, one place to look for an “equal crowd” is the various Highlights areas, like Photo of the Day, or <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Meet_our_photographers\">Meet our photographers</a>. Today, those lists are mostly of men, and even some of the older admins.</p>\n<p>Those public lists are a place to look for fostering more diverse representation in the community. How could the procedure for creating those lists be realigned with a positive and welcomed diversity agenda?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Changing precedents</em></strong></p>\n<p>During my research, I was shocked to see a photograph of a naked woman show up on the homepage of Commons, marked as Photo of the Day. I went to the Help Desk to ask “Why is OK to have a picture of a nude woman on the homepage?” I wasn’t crying OMG P0RN!, but suggesting that the image may be an alienating first image for some to encounter. It’s worth <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Help_desk&amp;oldid=305803393#Why_is_it_OK_to_have_a_picture_of_a_nude_woman_on_the_home_page?\">having a read</a> (and a mark of the strength of a wiki’s nature that I can retrieve the conversation). For me, it was telling that the rebuttals to my query ranged from tired responses around “pornography or art”, or that “galleries are full of naked women”, to more more resigned responses like “it’s already been decided”, or, “But this is the Internet, where the opinions of Western young men dominate, so good luck getting any sort of grown-up discussion about that.”</p>\n<p>The fact that there the system is full of old decisions that are no longer questioned is a problem. You can see how it’s now handed out as a “it’s the way we’ve always done it” response here, as another helpful person <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Village_pump&amp;oldid=305254391#Objection_to_placement_of_non-notable_naked_recumbent_woman_on_homepage_today\">chipped in with support for my query</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Featured_picture_candidates/File:Fine-art-nudesunpine.jpg\">see the original voting process in action, in November 2013</a>, which pushed the photo of the naked woman into the picture of the day category. (Warning: you’ll also see the naked woman on that page.) Of the 18 votes cast, at least 17 of them were by men, 3 of whom were admins, many of whom have been on Commons 5+ years, and a handful of whom are also featured photographers.</p>\n<p>I realise that this file and its life on Commons may be an easy target, but, it’s also indicative of the oligarchal participation and representation on Commons.</p>\n<p>What if featured photographs votes require a more representative voter group? What if you, as a user, could only have 10 featured photographs? What if the “Featured” lists were removed entirely?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the design of Wikimedia Commons in general, to make it easier to use?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George: </strong>If we’re talking about making it easier to use for individuals using the web interface, then yes, I do.</p>\n<p>There are just five user pages and one email in the UI that could be improved to help new folks get grounded. Making them crisp and instructional instead of information vs interface would have a huge effect. It’s about decluttering the copy and trying to help the new person figure out what to do first. The pages are <strong>User</strong>, (and <strong>welcome email</strong>), <strong>User talk</strong>, <strong>Watchlist</strong>, <strong>User contributions</strong>, and <strong>File list</strong>.</p>\n<p>For example, here’s the current Welcome email, the first point of contact from the Commons to an individual:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Hi there [Username],</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Welcome to Wikimedia Commons! Someone (probably you) from IP address 51.148.133.195, has registered an account “[Username]” with your email address here. We’re glad you decided to join us.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>What next? First you should confirm your account.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>To confirm that this account really does belong to you and activate email features on Wikimedia Commons, open this link in your browser:</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>After that, you’ll see ideas on how to get started and links to help you learn about Wikimedia Commons.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>From all of us here at Wikimedia Commons, welcome aboard!</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>If you did *not* register the account, follow this link to cancel the email address confirmation:</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>This confirmation code will expire at 13:53, 13 June 2018.</em></p>\n<p>This asks more questions than it answers, and even casts doubt on me being a legitimate user! “Someone (probably you) / “to confirm this account really does belong to you…” come across as defensive and doubtful. Hardly a friendly welcome for someone new.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the difference if you make it more concise:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Hi [Username],</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Welcome to Wikimedia Commons, the world’s free media library!</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Your first step is to confirm your email address, please:</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Once that’s done, there are a few ways we recommend getting started:</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>• Read the Policies and Guidelines of contributing to Wikimedia Commons<br />\n</em><em>• Take a Photo Challenge or Upload your first media file<br />\n</em><em>• Help improve information about Commons resources<br />\n</em><em>• Have a look around your account settings</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Good luck! And if you get stuck, please visit the Community Help Centre.</em></p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that I have absolutely no idea how I—an interested interface designer—could independently contribute effort towards making this part of the system better, just like I can edit regular entries.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Seeing each other</strong></em></p>\n<p>One of the reasons I think Flickr and other social systems are so successful is because we can <em>see each other </em>when we use them. They show people their own stuff, other people’s stuff, allow them to follow/connect/gather, show the activity happening—<em>particularly on your stuff because we all love that</em>—and often, give a short list of things to try next, to show the way through. We learn from the way other people act and operate in the physical world, and that’s the same on a software platform.</p>\n<p>The foundation is there on Commons to enhance representations of scale, activity, and actors to help people see each other more clearly. Improving those five core screens with these themes in mind would help locate new people in the system, and give them only as much information as they need, when they need it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ben: And what about suggestions on how to invite more and better contributions to Commons?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George: </strong>I would try to make it much more obvious that viewers can improve metadata; provide much clearer calls to action to interested people. I mean, it’s somewhat implied, given that it’s a Wikimedia system, but, as far as I can tell, the call to action to improve the metadata about a file is a small Edit link next to the Summary heading on the item’s page.</p>\n<p>Here’s the Pied-winged swallow, Picture of the Day on 3 September:</p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\">\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-59358\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pied-winged-piper-box.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"207\" /></div>\n</div>\n<p>If you have the gumption to click “Edit”, you get this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-59326\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pied-winged-swallow-2.png?w=512\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"293\" /></p>\n<p>So, even if you wanted to add information about the image &#8212; e.g. it’s taken outside, there’s blue sky, it’s a bird, etc &#8212; you have to figure out the editing code/pseudo code and its UI. I tried to add “tag=bird” for example, and it threw an error. It’s very different from having a UI designed specifically to encourage contributions and conversation. It’s not simple. (I realise that “special” images, like Picture of the Day, have protected edit capacity to prevent vandalism.)</p>\n<p>There’s a ton of uploading that happens to Commons that&#8217;s not through the UI, but with lots of other tools written to streamline the process. (That’s another strength of the system, and was at Flickr for that matter—that people can contribute to it through all sorts of interfaces.) I found myself wondering if another way to improve contributions to Commons might be to focus on the connective tissue between the various Wikimedia platforms, in the UI. If I upload an image to Commons, I could be actively prompted to create or enhance a Wikipedia page…</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have suggestions on how to make Wikimedia Commons a more interesting and useful platform for external organizations (e.g. GLAMs) to work with our communities and make their knowledge available?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George: </strong>I would look at three main areas around usefulness for institutions:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Reporting</strong></em></p>\n<p>Demonstrating use of collections, especially in a digital context, is especially difficult for institutions. If their stuff is nestled cosily amongst about 50 million other things, how and when can they know if the effort they’ve put in to sharing their treasures in the Commons is effective? Can any use of materials be reported on? Can that be established as new, legitimate usage of an institution’s materials? How can it be more refined, or indeed, more accurate than the mysterious “page view”. How can Commons help institutions (and individuals) see when their stuff is used? Something like the old school <a href=\"https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2009/01/21/2008-dopplr-per.html\">Dopplr Annual Report</a>, perhaps?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Presentation and presence</strong></em></p>\n<p>As I understand it, institutions either create a <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings_in_the_Nationalmuseum_Stockholm\">category</a> or use <a href=\"http://zone47.com/crotos/?p195=2817221\">a totally different system</a> to see all their media in one place. Can it provide a good destination for institutions to share around? What could their “User” page be like?</p>\n<p>If you look at the Wikipedia page for a contributing institution, e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalmuseum\">Nationalmuseum Stockholm</a>, you see this little box at the bottom:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-59327\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nationalmuseum-Stockholm-box.png?w=246\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"67\" /></p>\n<p>Even just rephrasing that to say “Explore the Nationalmuseum Stockholm’s 2,400 contributions to Wikimedia Commons” or perhaps creating another box that does that might be a start. That link also takes me to <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Nationalmuseum_Stockholm\">Category:Nationalmuseum Stockholm</a>, but it’s not immediately clear which items are from the collection versus about the institution.</p>\n<p>There’s obviously a question about whether institutions should be treated differently in the Commons context. I’m not sure about that. Perhaps it would be better to look for a way to enhance anyone’s presence equally. If part of the claimed benefit of participating in Commons is that metadata may be improved, visibility into the material also needs to be improved. What about a link on the home page to a list that shows all of the institutions?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Supporting people doing great stuff</strong></em></p>\n<p>When I was doing research, I attended a Wiki-a-thon at the Wellcome Collection in London. It was a day dedicated to improving the presence of women involved in medicine on Wikipedia. There were about eight people in the room, including the Wellcome Wikimedian in Residence, Alice. It was brilliant, and I could not have created my article on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Stone\">Clara Stone</a> without Alice in the room. The simple act of having a living human who could explain the rules and secret doors (like, you need to make 10 edits before you can make a page) instantly made the whole process more approachable.</p>\n<p>Human Wikimedian presence in cultural institutions can really help bridge the gap that’s sometimes perceived between authority and the crowd, which can be difficult for institutions to conquer on their own. This mediation is hugely valuable, and something that the Foundation could continue to support directly, and more. What if there was a Wikimedian in Residence at every national library in the world? (And lots of the smaller ones too?!?)</p>\n<p>I was also surprised to discover that lots of the updates to Commons are done en masse, through scripts and other programmes developed by volunteers. What sorts of other support could the Foundation provide for these folks? How can it support this developer community even more than it does now? What new efforts and resources can be amplified to reach more potential users (both outside and within GLAMs)?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ben: Any last thoughts on what a community-driven media repository like Wikimedia Commons could become in the future?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George: </strong>I was a bit surprised that this work turned out to be about representation in the end. Yes, there are simple interface changes that could be made to continue to improve usability, but there’s a huge challenge for Commons (and other huge collections online like Europeana and DPLA) to improve description of their millions of things so they’re easier to see.</p>\n<p>As we’ve <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appointment_and_confirmation_to_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States\">just seen in the United States</a>, oligarchies don’t like change and giving up control, but what if <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16385\">diversity trumps ability</a>?</p>\n<p>These vast online collections will eventually see a return of the power and delicacy of curation. Only machines can consume 50 million things, and even then they might not be sure exactly what those things are, and if they find something interesting they won’t know who to tell. Computers “<a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/discovery/homo-faber\">scan everything and hear nothing</a>,” so we need all kinds of humans from all over the world to help gather our histories into meaningful units, but right now, Commons is a pretty closed system.</p>\n<p>Imagine if Commons could become like one of the great old cities of the world, full of all kinds of people from all kinds of places instead of a big city run by a tiny group of people who basically look the same?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><em>Interview by Ben Vershbow, Director, Community Programs<br />\nSandra Fauconnier, Program Officer, Community Programs<br />\nWikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n<h3>Footnote</h3>\n<p>[1] The admin data consists of two views: (1) The list on the right side of the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators\">Commons:Administrators</a> page, and (2) those users listed on the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful_requests_for_adminship\">Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful requests for adminship</a>, which I edited manually to separate users who’d ever been admins from those who remain admins.

It was challenging for the judges to make their final decision as all proposed solutions appeared to be innovative and applicable. The three winning teams were Klima Kage, Climap &amp; Bird&#8217;s Eye View. Additionally, the judges also selected three runner-ups ThreeWolves, DBTFC &amp; GreenELF, whose projects directly address the issues related to climate change in the country.</span></p>\n<h4>Winning Projects: Klima Kage, Bird&#8217;s Eye View and Climap</h4>\n<p><strong>Klima Kage </strong>is a website application which consists of two parts: main page and community page. The main page contains data from open source database and tutorials extracted from the UNESCO handbook for journalists on climate change and sustainable development in Asia Pacific, which directly assist journalists in selecting data to monitor.</p>\n<p>On the community side, there is a forum for discussion and a news section where relevant articles will be published. The team decided to give priority to female journalists (ration 6:4) in reviewing and releasing news articles on this page, as a way to raise public awareness on gender dimension. SUSI.AI was also integrated into the web app to record users’ behaviour and offer suggestions for their next visits.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_17655\" style=\"width: 750px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-attachment-id=\"17655\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/unesco-hackathon-vietnam-2018-wrap-up/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?fit=750%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-17655\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?resize=750%2C563&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?resize=750%2C563&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?resize=267%2C200&amp;ssl=1 267w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Klima Kage (Sieben) Team</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Bird’s Eye View</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a mobile game built in unity with an objective to educate people about the impacts of climate change on all kind of creatures under the sea.

Yet, from 19 to 21 September, Wikimedians, art curators, and scientists <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Wikidata_for_research/Meetups/2018-09-19-21-New-York\">gathered at the New Museum</a> in New York City’s Lower East Side for a three-day workshop to talk about an emerging technology designed to make storing and structuring data free and accessible. The focal point was an increasingly vital piece of the Wikimedia ecosystem that makes linked data possible for everyone: Wikibase.</p>\n<p>Wikibase is a little-known standalone piece of software that powers Wikimedia’s popular new linked-data project <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page\">Wikidata</a>.  (This is similar to how Wikipedia is powered by a general wiki software called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki\">MediaWiki</a>, which is used everywhere from NASA to MuppetWiki.)  Since 2012, Wikidata has been growing to fill an increasingly important role in the Wikimedia community: connecting, sharing and providing tools for turning Wikipedia’s text strings into useful, searchable, machine-readable.  Wikidata’s content informs research and cultural heritage institutions, as well as digital tools like Google’s Knowledge Graph. None of this would be possible without Wikibase—which makes the Wikidata’s linked open data project possible and practical.</p>\n<p>In the last few years, an expanding community of researchers, GLAMs, and other knowledge communities have been experimenting with using Wikibase for their own repositories of knowledge, distinct from the central Wikidata knowledge collected by Wikimedians. But this nascent community of Wikibase reusers is just emerging, and deploying an open source technology not originally designed for third-party use can be challenging.</p>\n<p>The September Wikidata workshop gathered a subgroup of these pioneering data explorers to better understand how to realize Wikibase as a robust independent project distinct from the Wikidata platform, and to turn it into a tool that can offer core infrastructure for the work of scholars and GLAMs as they collect, describe and analyze their diverse stores of both facts and artifacts.  The key question: how could Wikibase reach and meet the needs of professionals across a broad community of emerging and established institutions.</p>\n<p>The gathering was made possible through a generous grant by the Sloan Foundation.  It was hosted and sponsored by one of the early adopters of this technology, <a href=\"http://rhizome.org\">Rhizome</a> (documented in our Many Faces of Wikibase <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/\">blog series</a>), and co-organized with <a href=\"https://wikimedia.de/en\">Wikimedia Germany (Deutschland)</a>.</p>\n<h3>What do you talk about in a Wikibase workshop?</h3>\n<p>The Wikibase workshop began with talks by participants highlighting their work in the realms of Wikidata, Wikibase, and more generally representing and working with linked data. Participants came with varying levels of experience with Wikidata and Wikibase, from interested newcomers to intrepid early adopters of the technology.  So, the presentations created an important baseline understanding of what is happening with Wikibase and what its possibilities and pain points are.</p>\n<p>Day one explored both the many opportunities and the number of underlying concerns exploring and integrating a new technology. Are we the only ones experiencing challenges? Are there tools that could help us solve our problems? What kind of future can we build for increasing adoption of the software?</p>\n<p>At the same time presenters brought striking examples of advanced use.  Digital art specialists described how they use Wikimedia tools for art preservation <em>Rhizome </em><a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/\">using Wikibase</a>, and <em>SFMOMA</em> using Mediawiki. Michigan State University’s <a href=\"http://enslaved.org/\">Enslaved.org</a> and Pratt University’s <a href=\"https://linkedjazz.org/\">Linked Jazz Project</a> showed off the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@thisismattmiller/wikibase-for-research-infrastructure-part-1-d3f640dfad34\">power of wikibase and linked data for exploring the cultural record</a>.  GLAM professionals from the Smithsonian, New York’s METRO library consortium, and York University highlighted the potential applications of Wikidata to their own varied and vast collections spaces.</p>\n<p>During the second day, we broke into working groups focused on understanding practical ways which Wikibase can be better supported for arts and research communities. Tracks focused on UI/UX improvements, making Wikibase easier to install and use, developing a Wikibase community, improving data modeling on Wikibase. The groups each provided <a href=\"https://notepad.rhizome.org/s/LOD-Wikibase-Summit-NYC\">pages of documentation and specific recommendations</a> that can be used as part of Wikibase’s development going forward (including, for example, <a href=\"https://notepad.rhizome.org/zMnfc5tPTwa8ajcUiTzPQA?both\">concept sketches</a> for changes to the platform that would help GLAM and humanities researchers use Wikibase).</p>\n<p>By day three, the community in the room had a strong sense of solidarity and shared purpose: that we can imagine are future in which Wikibase powers GLAM and research institutions to strengthen the exchange and connection of knowledge. We wrapped up the workshop with a session of sharing and reflecting, and then finished documenting the event, with next steps and links to notes on the conference meetup page, technical feature requests on phabricator tickets, and this very blog post.</p>\n<h3>It’s more than just gathering together—it’s about creating a community</h3>\n<p>An overwhelming theme throughout the workshop was the questions of, <em>what’s next</em>? In the wrapup conversations, the answers came back to facilitating a growing community of users who want to apply the Wikibase technology to the work of researchers and GLAMs. Key to forming the community would be figuring out what stories we can tell, and how we can tell them to new audiences.</p>\n<p>Most of the participants in the New York Workshop were new users of Wikibase—very much still learning. In a community-driven environment like Wikimedia, sometimes the best outcome of an event is developing a larger community of knowledge-holders, of individuals able to explain, support and facilitate understanding of a practice or set of projects. With the Wikibase workshop, we helped a larger group of community members share their knowledge and gain knowledge from others. So, the next time a question arises on the <a href=\"https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikibaseug\">Wikibase users mailing list</a>, or a colleague expresses as interest in Wikibase, they know who else to connect with. In short: the workshop helped produce more nodes in our growing Wikibase linked data network.</p>\n<p>This budding community would not have been able to form without the amazing facilitation of Dragan Espenschied (<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q111053\">Q111053</a> on Wikidata) from Rhizome and Sandra Müllrick from Wikimedia Deutschland, along with their teams.  The organizers facilitated a collegial, knowledge exchange that can lead to a growing web of Wikibase users and community participants.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Stinson, Senior Strategist, Community Programs, Wikimedia Foundation</em><br />\n<em>Jake Orlowitz, The Wikipedia Library, Community Programs, Wikimedia Foundation</em><br />\n<em>Jens Ohlig, Software Communications Strategist, Software Development, Wikimedia Germany (Deutschland)</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>To learn more about Wikibase or the growing community of Wikibase users, join the conversation on the </em><a href=\"https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikibaseug\"><em>Wikibase community mailing list </em></a><em> or the </em><a href=\"https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikidata\"><em>Wikidata community mailing list</em></a><em>, follow the </em><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Status_updates\"><em>Wikidata Weekly status updates</em></a><em>, and share your stories with </em><em>jens.ohlig</em><em>[at]</em><em>wikimedia[dot]org</em>.</p>\n","published":"2018-10-24T16:00:22.000Z","author":"Alex Stinson, Jake Orlowitz and Jens Ohlig","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/24/wikibasenyc-conference/","feed":{"source":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/feed/","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org","name":"Wikimedia Foundation"}},{"title":"Big Data Spatial com GeoMesa","content":"[object Object]","published":"2018-10-24T10:30:49.000Z","author":"Fernando Quadro","link":"http://www.fernandoquadro.com.br/html/2018/10/24/big-data-spatial-com-geomesa/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Nuevo partner del Liquid Galaxy LAB: stimulo, Agencia de Diseño de Producto e Innovación","content":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Rw9tBs-gMbc/W886knRpC-I/AAAAAAAGr-Y/7pO5hDXPYq8RA2GRm60e9YacJaUnBJZggCLcBGAs/s1600/stimulo-logo.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"130\" data-original-width=\"400\" height=\"104\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Rw9tBs-gMbc/W886knRpC-I/AAAAAAAGr-Y/7pO5hDXPYq8RA2GRm60e9YacJaUnBJZggCLcBGAs/s320/stimulo-logo.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><a href=\"http://www.stimulo.com/es/\">stimulo</a>, la Agencia de Diseño de Producto e Innovación, con sede en Barcelona y China, inicia su colaboración con los laboratorios TIC del Parc Cientific de Lleida, en este caso con el Liquid Galaxy LAB, desarrollando una carcasa diseñada especialmente para los niñxs y el entorno escolar de un kit AIY del Google Assistant.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p88BRK7Ng0U/W8870BPo4uI/AAAAAAAGr-k/SE1ZVkPUidsp3VJAHMV7bW9KpuIT8JXRwCLcBGAs/s1600/LiquidGalaxy%2Bfor%2BEducation%2Blogo.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"550\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"68\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p88BRK7Ng0U/W8870BPo4uI/AAAAAAAGr-k/SE1ZVkPUidsp3VJAHMV7bW9KpuIT8JXRwCLcBGAs/s200/LiquidGalaxy%2Bfor%2BEducation%2Blogo.jpeg\" width=\"200\" /></a></div><br />Esta carcasa tendrà como finalidad básica convertirse en pieza angular del interface de usuario del proyecto <a href=\"http://www.liquidgalaxylab.com/search/label/Liquid%20Galaxy%20for%20Education\">Liquid Galaxy para Educación</a>, en desarrollo actualmente en los laboratorios, el cual es una adaptación de la tecnologia Liquid Galaxy orientada a escuelas y otros centros educativos.

Per aquest motiu, està dissenyat per facilitar-los la iniciació mitjançant un conjunt de tasques, que proveeixen organitzacions com el Liquid Galaxy LAB del Parc Científic. Els preuniversitaris seleccionen les tasques i les treballen amb l’ajut d’un mentor durant vàries setmanes. Cada tasca té una durada de 3 a 5 hores i els estudiants disposen de 3 dies per acabar-la i després, si ho volen, continuar amb una de nova.<br /><br />Les tasques són de 5 tipus diferents i no únicament de programació, la qual cosa amplia a tots els escolars la possibilitat de presentar-s’hi. Al tractar-se d’un programa mundial, totes les preguntes, respostes i comunicacions es fan en anglès.<br /><br /><img height=\"139\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1WhH2ptYnjIoseZjQKliUhEftPNqsmIIrjRYsfoPn5ANAoi3daUCEBdJwUp4oC2_viPu7a1v20kvOg5GiL39l_EzdL6eN_9bzHuho5OknZR4zCfvodIPJd4gOypZqEvA_K_oPS-C\" width=\"640\" /><br /><br />El concurs està dotat amb diversos premis, que depenen del nombre de tasques que finalitzin i de quantes en facin els estudiants: des de diplomes de Google (1 tasca), samarretes (3 o més tasques), assuadores ii, fins i tot, guanyar un viatge a la central de Google, situada a Silicon Valley (Califòrnia), amb un familiar o tutor.<br /><br />Des del 2010, més de 4.500 estudiants de 99 països han participat en el programa Google Code-in. El Liquid Galaxy LAB del Parc Científic va gestionar el passat concurs 2017-2018 més de 500 estudiants de tot el món, entre els quals hi havia vàries dotzenes de lleidatans.<br /><br /><br /><b>Objectius </b>Que nenes i nens de Lleida i arreu del mòn aconsegueixin una experiència mundial única i amb una marca tan reconeguda com Google mitjançant la participació en aquesta nova edició.

(That number has since jumped to 17.67 percent, meaning an average of 72 new articles on women were added to English Wikipedia every single day for the past 3.5 years.)</p>\n<p>In the past three years, Women in Red has collaborated with outside institutions like museums and libraries that want to put on edit-a-thons, and developed lists of “redlinks”—non-existing Wikipedia articles—of women who should have material written about them. But the group doesn’t stop at biographies.</p>\n<p>“Our scope includes women&#8217;s works (such as the paintings they painted, the schools the founded, the conferences they convened), as well as women&#8217;s issues (such as women&#8217;s suffrage and women&#8217;s health),” says Stephenson-Goodnight.</p>\n<h3>A helpful space for newcomers</h3>\n<p>Women in Red is known for helping newcomers navigate the technical rules of Wikipedia—which can be overwhelming for new contributors. Sue Barnum, a volunteer Librarian-in-Residence with Women in Red, points to the group’s friendly and helpful nature as a key reason why it has been so successful.</p>\n<p>“We support one another and help each other with our articles, references and technical details. If you need help, we&#8217;re going to help or find someone who can,” she says. “I&#8217;ll try to help people get access to articles or books behind paywalls. Sometimes I&#8217;ll even go to nearby libraries to access the actual book to help people verify their sources if the book or journal is only available offline.”</p>\n<h3>The focus is on why women matter</h3>\n<p>Editor SusunW, a founding member of Women in Red, recently <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2018-05-24/Blog\">wrote an essay</a> about why she focuses on writing about women on Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>“I learn as much from writing women’s biographies as I impart from telling their stories,” she writes. “For example, in the pre-internet world, the international links between people and the organizations in which they participated were much stronger than you might imagine. The analytical part of researching the interconnections, and reward of working with editors who want to improve articles, is a motivating factor to me—as is the hope that the women in generations who follow will grow up knowing that women have always been actively involved in the world around them and were not passively allowing the world to go by.”</p>\n<p>Making women—and their role in history—more visible is a motivating factor for many participants to Women in Red.</p>\n<p>“I grew up believing that women didn&#8217;t do anything interesting,” says Barnum. “It&#8217;s sad that I believed that, because it isn&#8217;t true. I believed this because women&#8217;s contributions become invisible, especially after their deaths. There are many articles I&#8217;ve worked on where a woman was quite nationally famous during her lifetime, but after she dies, she somehow &#8220;fails&#8221; to make it into the canon that describes the subject she was involved in. This is really tragic and I&#8217;m glad that there are historians out there writing about women who have been hidden in history.”</p>\n<p><strong>You can make a difference</strong></p>\n<p>Inspired to join Women in Red?  There are many ways to get involved. For starters, Women in Red has put together a p<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Essays/Primer_for_creating_women%27s_biographies\">rimer for creating women&#8217;s biographies&#8221;</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Essays/Ten_Simple_Rules_for_Women_in_Red\">&#8220;ten Simple Rules for Creating Women&#8217;s Biographies&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a place to jump in, Barnum recommends starting with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Redlist_index\">the lists</a> that Women in Red has put together on women that are notable by Wikipedia’s standards and who need biographies written about them.</p>\n<p>“Pick someone from a subject area you enjoy writing about and then make sure you have several reliable sources to backup your writing,” she says.</p>\n<p>SusunW adds that you don’t necessarily need to start with a full biography. “If there do not appear to be sufficient sources to add a standalone biography on a woman, she can be added to events she participated in and organizations she was involved with, provided reliable sourcing can confirm her activities.”</p>\n<p>For example, if a woman participated in an academic conference, adding her name to the list of participants—with proper sourcing—may help someone write a biography about her at a later date.</p>\n<p>And Stephenson-Goodnight says you can always update an existing article. “Add a reference, add an internal link to another article, fix the punctuation, or improve the opening paragraph,” she says.</p>\n<h3>If you need help</h3>\n<p>Don’t be overwhelmed if you start to edit and find yourself confused. There are many ways to get help! You can post on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Women_in_Red\">talk page of  Women in Red</a>, as well as the talk pages for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Rosiestep\">Rosie</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Megalibrarygirl\">Sue</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SusunW\">SusunW</a>. (A talk page is like a message board where people communicate about a topic or article.)</p>\n<p>“If you get stuck or have questions, remember that all of us were new once and others helped us, so we&#8217;re glad to respond to your questions,” says Stephenson-Goodnight. “You can also reach me via Twitter or Facebook or email.”</p>\n<p>And if you’d rather work with people in person, there are opportunities for that too.</p>\n<p>“If you live near a city which has a Wikimedia Affiliate (Chapter, Thematic Organization, or User Group), check in with them regarding their events schedule. There&#8217;s an international list available on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup\">this Meetup page</a>. Or ask us at Women in Red to assist you in the search,” says Stephenson-Goodnight.</p>\n<h3>Helping beyond editing</h3>\n<p>And one last thing: you don’t need to edit Wikipedia to meaningfully contribute to Women in Red. You can tweet or post about new articles on social media (including the handle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikiwomeninred\">@WikiWomenInRed</a>), help find archival material, or help access photos that are licensed properly.</p>\n<p>“Having people who are willing to reach out to individuals to secure a license for a picture to be used on Commons is very helpful,” says Barnum. “Others may have access to archives or books that are offline and can help provide access to other editors.”</p>\n<p>And your work—whether an edit, a tweet, or a photo—is meaningful, and makes a difference <em>on </em>Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>“We are making a difference, one article at a time, making for incremental corrections to the systemic bias depicted in the written canon,” says Stephenson-Goodknight. “I can&#8217;t imagine doing anything more worthwhile with my free time.”</p>\n<p><em>Interview by Melody Kramer, Senior Audience Development Manager, Communications</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n","published":"2018-10-18T17:00:39.000Z","author":"Melody Kramer","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/18/women-in-red-wikiproject/","feed":{"source":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/feed/","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org","name":"Wikimedia Foundation"}},{"title":"Wikipedia is a mirror of the world’s gender biases","content":"<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>This post ran in the </em>Los Angeles Times <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-maher-wikipedia-gender-bias-20181018-story.html\"><em>on 18 October 2018</em></a>.</p>\n<p>When Donna Strickland won the Nobel Prize this month, she became only the third woman in history to receive the award in physics. An optical physicist at the University of Waterloo, Strickland is brilliant, accomplished and inspiring. To use Wikipedia parlance, she is very clearly notable.</p>\n<p>Except that, somehow, she wasn’t. Despite her groundbreaking research on a method of generating laser beams with ultrashort pulses, Strickland did not have a Wikipedia page until shortly after her Nobel win.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more disconcerting, a volunteer Wikipedia editor had drafted a page about Strickland in March only to have it declined in May. The reason: There wasn’t enough coverage of Strickland’s work in independent secondary sources to establish her notability. Her achievements simply weren’t documented in enough news articles that Wikipedia editors could cite.</p>\n<p>Before Wikipedia points a finger that might rightly be pointed back at us, let me acknowledge that Wikipedia’s shortcomings are absolutely real. Our contributors are majority Western and mostly male, and these gatekeepers apply their own judgment and prejudices. As a result, Wikipedia has dozens of articles about battleships and not nearly enough on poetry. We’ve got comprehensive coverage on college football but significantly less on African marathoners.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Wikipedia is by design a living, breathing thing—a collection of knowledge that many sources, in aggregate, say is worth knowing. It is therefore a reflection of the world’s biases more than it is a cause of them.</p>\n<p>We are working to correct biases in Wikipedia’s coverage. For instance, in 2014, Wikipedia editors evaluated all the biographies on English Wikipedia and found that only about 15% of them were about women. To rectify the imbalance, groups of volunteers, including the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_scientists\">WikiProject Women Scientists</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red\">WikiProject Women in Red</a>, have been identifying women who should have pages and creating articles about them.</p>\n<p>Today, 17.82% of our biographies are about women. This near 3% jump may not sound like much, but it represents 86,182 new articles. That works out to 72 new articles a day, every single day, for the past three and a half years.</p>\n<p>But signs of bias pop up in different ways. A 2015 study found that, on English Wikipedia, the word “divorced” appears more than four times as often in biographies of women than in biographies of men. We don’t fully know why, but it’s likely a multitude of factors, including the widespread tendency throughout history to describe the lives of women through their relationships with men.</p>\n<p>Technology can help identify such problems. Wikipedia articles about health get close attention from our community of medical editors, but for years, some articles on critical women’s health issues, such as breastfeeding, languished under a “low importance” categorization. An algorithm identified this mistake.</p>\n<p>But there is only so much Wikipedia itself can do. To fix Wikipedia’s gender imbalance, we need our contributors and editors to pay more attention to the accomplishments of women. This is true across all under-represented groups: people of color, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people, indigenous communities.</p>\n<p>Although we don’t believe that only women editors should write pages about other women, or writers of color about people of color, we do think that a broader base of contributors and editors—one that included more women and people of color, among others—would naturally help broaden our content.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia is founded on the concept that every individual should be able to share freely in the sum of all knowledge. We believe in “knowledge equity,” <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Direction\">which we define</a> as as the idea that diverse forms of knowledge should be recognized and respected. Wikipedia is not limited to what fits into a set of encyclopedias.</p>\n<p>We also need other fields to identify and document diverse talent. If journalists, book publishers, scientific researchers, curators, academics, grant-makers and prize-awarding committees don’t recognize the work of women, Wikipedia’s editors have little foundation on which to build.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, Wikipedia’s content and any biases therein have ramifications well beyond our own website. For instance, Wikipedia is now relied upon as a major source in the training of powerful artificial intelligence models, including models that underlie common technologies we all use.</p>\n<p>In such training processes, computers ingest large data sets, draw inferences from patterns in the data and then generate predictions. As is well understood in the programming world, bad or incomplete data generate biased outcomes. This phenomenon is known by the acronym GIGO: garbage in, garbage out.</p>\n<p>People may intuitively understand that Wikipedia is a perennial work in progress. Computers, on the other hand, simply process the data they’re given. If women account for only 17.82% of the data, we may find ourselves with software that thinks women are only 17.82% of what matters in the world.</p>\n<p>It is true that Wikipedia has a problem if Donna Strickland, an accomplished physicist, is considered worthy of a page only when she receives the highest possible recognition in her field. But this problem reflects a far more consequential and intractable problem in the real world.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia would like to encourage other knowledge-generating institutions to join us in our efforts to balance this inequity. We may not be able to change how society values women, but we can change how women are seen, and ensure that they are seen to begin with. That’s a start.</p>\n<p><em>Katherine Maher, Executive Director</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Women_in_STEM_(Wikipedia_Year_of_Science).png\">Image adaptation</a> by Eryk Salvaggio/Wiki Education Foundation, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>;

It goes something like this:</p>\n<p>Five years ago, four friends—Siân Evans, Jacqueline Mabey, Michael Mandiberg, and Laurel Ptak—gathered together to discuss an idea for promoting Wikipedia as a place to challenge one of the ways women are silenced: through the preservation of information. That discussion became the Art+Feminism campaign.</p>\n<p>Our goals today still revolve around combating gender inequity on the internet, using Wikipedia as a tool for correcting the written record on cis and trans women. And in the last year, all of us—from the leadership collective to the thousands of organizers, artists, librarians, activists, and editors who make up our global Art+Feminism community—have experienced many lessons, challenges, and triumphs.</p>\n<p>Take the month of March, for example. Over 4,000 people at more than 315 Art+Feminism events around the world came together to create or improve nearly 22,000 pages on Wikipedia, with a total of 43,000 content pages created or improved! That’s <em>four</em> times the output of our 2017 events. Four times. Out of 357 initiatives across 80 countries, we were named as 1 of 5 finalists in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/equals/status/1041695010339606528\">#EQUALSinTech</a> Leadership Award Category.</p>\n<p>Our fifth-annual <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/3941\">Wikipedia edit-a-thon at the Museum of Modern Art</a>, an all-day event designed to generate coverage of feminism and the arts on Wikipedia, took place on 3 March 2018 with hundreds of partner events around the world. It featured tutorials for the beginner Wikipedian, ongoing editing support, training on combating implicit and explicit biases, reference materials, childcare, and refreshments, with the leading panel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHcd1lfZ4ws\">“Careful with Each Other, Dangerous Together,”</a> about the relationship between structures of inequality on the internet, the emotional labor of internet activism, and creating inclusive online communities with Caroline Sinders, Sydette Harry, Salome Asega, and Sarah Jaffe.</p>\n<p>Art+Feminism’s regional organizers continue to amplify the way the project resonates with and reaches people all over the world. This year, <a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/04/05/tentaciones/1522922021_036290.html\">we focused on Latin America</a>, where Melissa Tamani has done concentrated outreach, quadrupling the number of events in that region compared to last year.  These nearly 30 events stretched from Laboratorio Cultural del Norte, Chihuahua, Mexico, to the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de Santiago.</p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\" id=\"attachment_59270\"><div class=\"img-in-text\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-59270\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ArtAndFeminism-MoMA18-14-Panel.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></div><div class=\"img-caption\"><span class=\"photo-caption\">Panel discussion about Art+Feminism at The Museum of Modern Art, New York City, 3 March 2018.</span> <span class=\"photo-credit\"></span></div></div>\n<p>Our success is because of the commitment that we share with hundreds of organizers around the world to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/15/wikipedia-edit-a-thon-women-arts\">the voices of cis and trans women made visible</a> and their achievements shared just as widely as their male identified peers. We want to see justice done and each year,  we work to refine our strategies, our organizing, and our materials so that they are made even more accessible than the year before. With that goal in mind, we launched our <em><a href=\"http://www.artandfeminism.org/organizing-kit/\">Quick Guide for Organizers</a></em> and our <em><a href=\"http://www.artandfeminism.org/editing-kit/\">Quick Guide for (New) Editors</a></em>. Both guides have been made available on our training materials page in English and Spanish. On 30 September of this year, we are launching our redesigned training guides for organizers in PPT form in English and Spanish with more guides to follow translated into French and at least one African language with the goal of translating our materials for new editors and organizers into at least five additional languages in the next three years of our campaign. In addition to content focused on quick tips for organizing edit-a-thons and editing Wikipedia for the first time; we’ll be launching even more materials in the future focused specifically on advancing gender justice on the internet, designing brave/safe space policies through a lens knowledge equity and anti-harassment, and more.</p>\n<p>Beginning this project, we knew that our role would not only be to empower cis and trans women to edit online but to stand with them as they are challenged by those who do not see value in their perspective nor value in them. Art+Feminism is about making Wikipedia a more complete and representative source of information, but it doesn’t end there for us. It’s about dismantling systems of thought that diminish or erase entirely the place marginalized people and their communities have in our history.</p>\n<p>As we have addressed many glaring omissions about women on Wikipedia, we have seen our focus turn towards improving existing articles: for example, the first year we created 101 new articles, and improved roughly the same number, while this year we improved 7 times as many articles as we created.</p>\n<p>Our task is to take what we’ve made to the next level. From there, our task is to leverage the reach and impact of our social justice community to recognize that Wikipedia is just one of many tools that can be used to combat gender inequity and biased, informative content on the internet. We have so much to do, and we’re ready to take on the task of continuing to iterate and improve as our campaign evolves and adapts as it needs to.</p>\n<p>Look at what we’ve done—and there&#8217;s even more to come.</p>\n<p><em>McKensie Mack, Director<br />\nArt+Feminism</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>We couldn’t do this work without our supporters, our partners, and our Regional Ambassadors: AfroCROWD; Black Lunch Table; Women in Red; the Professional Organization for Women in the Arts (POWarts); and The Museum of Modern Art.

Over the past two months, the Developer Advocacy team at the Wikimedia Foundation collaborated with two open source initiatives: Mozilla’s <a href=\"https://opensource.mozilla.community/\">Open Source Student Network (OSSN)</a> and TeachingOpenSource.org&#8217;s <a href=\"http://foss2serve.org/index.php/POSSE\">Professors&#8217; Open Source Software Experience</a>  (TOS and POSSE, respectively). OSSN is designed to bring more students into open source projects, while POSSE aims to provide more professional development resources for professors.</p>\n<p>Mozilla&#8217;s pilot project, which is currently underway at colleges in the United States and Canada, aims to help university students find suitable open source projects to engage with. Before its launch, Mozilla researched the state of open source on college campuses, as well as criteria that students might consider in choosing a project. Based on this research, Mozilla developed <a href=\"https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/cracking-the-code-how-mozilla-is-helping-university-students-contribute-to-open-source-25fa630d8c5c\">an overview template for project selection</a> that presents the four most relevant (and often not properly surfaced) criteria at a glance: the mission of the project, technology, time needed for setting up the development environment, and how to connect with the community.</p>\n<p>POSSE, meanwhile, provides professional development experience to professors interested in teaching open source through Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) projects. POSSE began as an outreach effort by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat\">Red Hat</a> to the higher education community.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, our team, met with the contributors to the Mozilla’s Open Source Student Network (OSSN) and POSSE initiative at the <a href=\"https://libreplanet.org/2018/\">LibrePlanet conference</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We saw an opportunity to further support student contributors on the Wikimedia projects by collaborating with these two initiatives.</p>\n<p>There are two primary reasons why we are excited about this collaboration.</p>\n<p>First, we have received quite a lot of requests from professors or students interested in teaching open source in academia through Wikimedia projects. We get asked how to assess projects and incorporate them into semester-long coursework. We’ve always wondered how to help them best.</p>\n<p>In the past, we have partnered directly with university faculty to help shape projects for their students, which are both educational for them and beneficial for us. For example, last spring we worked with graduate students and faculty in <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Technical_Document_Re-working_Group/Technical_Communication_Outreach_and_Events#Technical_Communication_Collaboration,_Spring_2018:_BSU_&amp;_Cloud_Services_Technical_Documentation_Audit_and_Recommendations\">Boise State University’s Technical Writing program to audit and evaluate technical documentation for our Cloud Services team.</a>  The students were able to advise a real world client (our team), and we used their valuable recommendations to inform our approach. We would love to be able to provide focused support like this to everyone who asks. We are often able to  provide a <a href=\"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T169709\">project showcase and developer support</a> help, but we find we also have to defer many requests.</p>\n<p>Second, in our <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/New_Developers/Quarterly#Summary_of_key_findings\">year-long research study with 61 new developers to Wikimedia projects</a>, we learned that most new developers who we attract are working professionals. However, students get onboarded through our targeted outreach efforts via mentoring programs such as Google Summer of Code, Outreachy, Google Code-in and mentoring programs at hackathons.</p>\n<p>On the whole, this also ties into our <a href=\"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T199001\">bigger goal of collaborating with other FOSS communities</a> for engaging technical contributors.</p>\n<p>This collaboration with both the initiatives in its initial state is quite straight-forward and not quite resource intensive! We&#8217;ve proposed five <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/New_Developers\">newcomer-friendly projects</a> to be listed in the OSSN&#8217;s directory of projects: <a href=\"https://projects.ossn.club/\">https://projects.ossn.club/</a>. The project and mentor names are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES\">ORES</a>, Aaron Halfaker</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Newsletter\">Extension:Newsletter</a>, Tony Thomas</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Huggle\">Huggle</a>, Petr Bena</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/\">WikiEdu Dashboard</a>, Sage Ross</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Kiwix\">Kiwix</a>, Emmanuel Engelhart and Stephane Coillet-Matillon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Joining forces with Wikimedia for findings more effective ways to support University students while they are trying to contribute code to Open Source Projects is exciting! Students are looking to contribute to projects that are simple, diverse and have an impact; which is precisely what Wikimedia projects offer. I appreciate the time effort the project maintainers are putting aside for onboarding and supporting new contributors and looking forward to working with them.” &#8211; <a href=\"https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/bacharakis/\">Christos Bacharakis</a>, Mozilla Open Source Student Network &#8211; Program Manager</p>\n<p>For POSSE, we are now <a href=\"http://foss2serve.org/index.php/HFOSS_Projects#Education\">listed</a> as an organization in their directory of HFOSS projects under the Education category. The link contains getting started instructions. When we are approached by students and professors, we are willing to offer help!</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to have the Wikimedia Foundation working with TOS to engage students in Wikimedia projects,&#8221; said <a href=\"http://teachingopensource.org/user/hislop/\">Gregory Hislop</a> of the TOS Coordinating Committee. &#8220;Today’s students have grown up using Wikipedia, and they are quite interested in learning about the technology and community behind the project. The educational goals of Wikimedia also provide an excellent introduction to computing for social good. We appreciate the Wikimedia Foundation’s leadership in providing opportunities for students.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With this collaboration, we are hoping to engage more university students in contributing to open source projects and support professors in their efforts of teaching open source through Wikimedia projects. We are looking forward to learning from the research findings that Mozilla will conduct post completion of the first pilot, which we could then leverage to improve some of our processes and workflows of supporting new developers. We would also be curious how professors use our projects to teach in a classroom setting, which we could then be shared with our collaborators in academia.</p>\n<p><em>Srishti Sethi, Developer Advocate, Technical Engagement</em><br />\n<em>Sarah Rodlund, Technical Writer, Technical Engagement</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n","published":"2018-10-12T17:00:44.000Z","author":"Srishti Sethi and Sarah Rodlund","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/12/wikimedia-foundation-collaboration-ossn-posse/","feed":{"source":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/feed/","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org","name":"Wikimedia Foundation"}},{"title":"Community digest: Writing about Islam in Hebrew; GLAM activity kicks off in Indonesia; news in brief","content":"<h3>Writing about Islam in Hebrew: Dar AsSalam Editors</h3>\n<p>Last January, Wikimedia communities around the world <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/01/30/community-digest-wikipedia-day-17/\">celebrated Wikipedia’s seventeenth birthday</a>—and Wikimedia Israel joined in. Held at the IBM office in Tel Aviv, nearly 60 Wikimedians attended, including a group of Palestinian editors from the Dar AsSalam Islamic Center (meaning House of Peace) in Kafr Qara, Haifa district.</p>\n<p>During the event, the Dar As-Salam group expressed their interest in volunteering to edit the Hebrew Wikipedia&#8217;s pages about Islam as a means to share Islamic culture with the Hebrew Wikipedia reader. A resulting few months of collaboration between the Dar AsSalam group and the Hebrew Wikipedia community has resulted the creation of 60 new pages, in addition to 150 others improved.</p>\n<p>It all started when the Dar AsSalam group introduced themselves to the Hebrew Wikipedia community. They offered to improve the content about Islam, Islamic culture, history and theology on the Hebrew Wikipedia. In their conversations with veteran Hebrew Wikipedia editors, the group mentioned their need for support, and they got some from Avner Avandrovic, veteran Hebrew Wikipedian and a member of the training staff at Wikimedia Israel. Avandrovic traveled to Kafr Qara in March 2018 to lead a Wikipedia editing workshop. Moderated by Bekriah S. Mawasi, the Arabic Education coordinator at Wikimedia Israel, the meetings took place in Dar AsSalam center, located inside the Nour al-Haq mosque in Kafr Qara.</p>\n<p>Dar AsSalam center is an information center aiming at providing information about Islam to Muslims and to visitors from different backgrounds and religions. The main objective of the center is to print out and give away Islamic books promoting the values of tolerance, moderation, openness, modesty and spirituality. Understanding other religions, develops curiosity about Islam. Another goal is creating a space for mutual understanding between different cultures in Israel as a way to promote a shared life, peace and respect for each other&#8217;s culture. The center publishes books and pamphlets explaining Islam, in both Hebrew and Arabic, including translation of the meanings of the Holy Koran.</p>\n<p>The editing course at Dar AsSalam included three meetings. Twelve Arabic speaking participants participated in the workshops and edited content in Hebrew. In addition to learning technical skills and editing the Hebrew Wikipedia, editors were introduced to the norms and policies of the Hebrew Wikipedia community and were encouraged to participate in discussions. They also learned about encyclopedic writing on religious topics. The group showed proficient understanding and full collaboration, and by the third meeting in August, they had written over 60 new articles and edited more than 150 other ones. The articles were diverse in content, ranging from <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%97%D7%99%D7%90%D7%90_%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%90-%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9F\">books</a>, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%92%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%AA\">theology</a>, and profiles of distinguished religious and historical figures. The group created new categories too and the mentioned achievements were completed within one month. They look forward to continuing in the future.</p>\n<p>Members of Dar AsSalam made prolific contributions to the Hebrew Wikipedia with references in English and Hebrew. Wikimedia Israel appreciates the commitment the group showed to free knowledge. Five of the group members joined the celebrations of the 15th anniversary of Hebrew Wikipedia which took place in Tel Aviv on 10 August 2018. Such collaborations are great opportunities to share diverse opinions within the Wikipedia communities and enhances collaborative content writing in the largest knowledge base.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Bks-WMIL\">Bekriah S.

There has been some progress in the governance of the cultural sector, particularly by passing the Law of Cultural Advancement No.5/2017 last year. However, the artists and art communities are by far noted as the primary parties making considerable contributions within the Indonesian art world.</p>\n<p>Given this landscape, a new GLAM-Wiki project could make a major difference in people&#8217;s access to digital collections in the Indonesian GLAM sector.</p>\n<p>On 30 and 31 May, Wikimedia Indonesia, together with Indonesian Arts Coalition, arranged a visit to Dr. H.C. Oemboe Hina Kapita Museum in Waingapu, East Nusa Tenggara. The museum allowed us to digitize their collection, which ranged from ceramic plates, ritual ceremony equipment, a few of traditional percussions, and of course, Sumbanese’s proud: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikat#Weft_ikat\">Weft ikat</a>, traditional pattern textile.</p>\n<p>On the first day, we started a discussion with the participants about how museums can respond to the digital era by utilizing technology to engage with the public. It is as easy as maintaining the information through apps and social media or using multimedia. The audience included museum staff, art practitioners, indigenous people and officials from the Office of Culture, Tourism, Public Library and Archive.</p>\n<p>Most locals can afford smartphones and frequently go online on social media. Thus, it is merely a matter of first; the lack of references on various internet platforms, and second; the lack of awareness about the internet. We are looking forward to doing some outreach work introducing Wikimedia Commons and Creative Commons licenses, in which they are embraced to be more active in sharing files which link to the local heritage they possess.</p>\n<p>On the second day we held a session for the participants to try their hands on Wikimedia Commons. We invited the museum staff members to guide the participants while they look around and pick the objects which represented local culture to be digitized, and this was the interesting part. The section where ceramic plates stored became our first destination. It was nice to see that at this phase both the staff and the audience starting to discuss the objects, which are believed to have a strong relationship with the Chinese trading, exchanging information to each other whilst enriching the story behind it. For instance, there was new information on one of the plates found inside the cemetery in an archaeological site.</p>\n<p>Over the two day event, we have successfully digitized and uploaded <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_from_Museum_Dr._(H.C)_Oemboe_Hina_Kapita\">18 images</a> to Wikimedia Commons, including short descriptions about the objects.</p>\n<p>“I could easily follow the instructions. There were no technical problems while working on Wikimedia Commons. I suppose we can do more to promote arts and culture in Sumba,” said Gusti Dida, a museum staff member who became a Wikimedia Commons contributor since then</p>\n<p>The Sumba Museum, as it also is called, is the only museum in Waingapu, West Sumba, where the island is sometimes visited by local and foreign tourists because of its beautiful savanna, horse riding culture, and famous colorful weft ikat. The museum once temporarily closed and reopened in 2016, yet the collections are not well maintained. We were lucky to be invited by the Secretary of the Office of Culture and Tourism to hold this first GLAM activity in a local museum in Indonesia.</p>\n<h4>Indonesian art and culture in the digital landscape</h4>\n<p>Geographical and governance factors are the biggest challenges we are facing in building a digital environment for the Indonesian art and culture. Based on that, Wikimedia Indonesia is seeking to collaborate with local cultural institutions to digitize their archives as well as persuaded them to be the contributors to all kinds of Wikimedia platforms. Majalah Horison, one of the oldest Indonesian literature magazine and Majalah Kajawen, the Javanese magazine during colonial times are examples of the digitization projects that running ahead.</p>\n<p>Now the museum staff of Dr. H.C Oemboe Hina Kapita Museum are able to produce and share knowledge by actively sharing their collection on Wikimedia Commons. At the end of the event, some participants were quite excited and offered the plan of making such follow-up activity in order to increase public attention towards the museum.</p>\n<p>Any contribution on Wikimedia projects related to Indonesian art and culture could be seen as ways to building wider network and existence on the Internet, emphasizing the local’s possession of their own culture, their own narratives that complement the interpretation by others.</p>\n<p><em>Annayu Maharani, Researcher, Indonesian Arts Coalition and member, Wikimedia Indonesia</em></p>\n<h3>In brief</h3>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\">\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-59212\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Prize_and_Certificate_distribution_ceremony_at_Wiki_Awareness_Campaign_Karnal_13.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"background-color: #eeeeee;padding: 10px\"><strong>The Wikipedia Library names Shweta Yadav as their star coordinator for April to June:</strong> &#8220;In 2007 while still a school student, our teacher asked us not to prepare assignments using Wikipedia considering it a non-reliable source,” <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Shypoetess\">Shweta Yadav</a> recalls. This was the beginning of Shweta’s curiosity towards Wikipedia and to understanding how it worked. Shweta further explained that even 10 years after these instructions, she become a culprit of the same criticisms as she found herself offering the same advice to her students. In an attempt to do what was right and to clear her conscience in teaching her students the right way to use an encyclopedia, she first participated in a 100 Wikidays challenge. She was introduced to the campaign by a colleague who got her editing. Through these efforts she discovered her curiosity was justified as the instructions given to her may have not been quite accurate.</p>\n<p style=\"background-color: #eeeeee;padding: 10px\">Shweta gradually started outreach activities in Karnal to increase awareness amongst students and academics about her discovery, and her plight to completely detach the “unreliable tag” to Wikipedia led her to The Wikipedia Library Program (TWL). She volunteered to become the coordinator for the Hindi Branch. “As a researcher I knew how knowledgeable a well-referenced article could be and that the availability of resources will attract good editors and increase quality of content.&#8221; Her thoughts on how crucial well-referenced articles are to Wikipedia led her to the creation of the first branch in India, the Hindi TWL Branch.</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 10px\"><strong>Bengali Wikisource community releases three promotional videos</strong>: The Bengali Wikisource community has launched an awareness campaign about their project.

Once the skill analytics was incorporated into the CMS we got a bunch of skill statistics and thus we enhanced the start page by incorporating horizontally scrollable skill cards as per skill metrics like top rated skills, most used skills, skills which have received the most feedback etc. I worked on adding the skills with most feedback section and the section for the top games. This post will majorly deal with how the metrics sections are implemented on the start page and how any new metrics can be incorporated into the system and thus displayed on the CMS.</span></p>\n<h3>About the API</h3>\n<p><!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #272822; overflow: auto; width: auto; border: solid gray; border-width: .1em .1em .1em

The server supports sending and receiving of data only in JSONAPI spec, so, we needed to serialize java models into JSON objects and deserialize JSON data into java models following JSONAPI spec. To achieve this we followed the following steps.</p>\n<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>\n<p>We will be using <a href=\"https://github.com/jasminb/jsonapi-converter\">jasminb/jsonapi-converter</a> which handles request/response parsing of models following JSONAPI Spec and Retrofit plugin of <a href=\"https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/jackson\">jackson converter</a> to serializing JSON to Java Models and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Let’s create a java model. We are using some annotations provided by <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/\">Lombok</a> library to avoid writing boilerplate code. @JsonNaming annotation is used to apply KebabCaseStrategy while serializing fields</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Data<br />\n@Type(&#8220;order&#8221;)<br />\n@AllArgsConstructor<br />\n@JsonNaming(PropertyNamingStrategy.KebabCaseStrategy.class)<br />\n@Table(database = OrgaDatabase.class, allFields = true)<br />\npublic class Order {</p>\n<p>@PrimaryKey<br />\n@Id(LongIdHandler.class)<br />\npublic Long id;</p>\n<p>public float amount;<br />\npublic String completedAt;<br />\npublic String identifier;<br />\npublic String paidVia;<br />\npublic String paymentMode;<br />\npublic String status;</p>\n<p>@Relationship(&#8220;event&#8221;)<br />\n@ForeignKey(stubbedRelationship = true, onDelete = ForeignKeyAction.CASCADE)<br />\npublic Event event;</p>\n<p>public Order() { }<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the NetworkModule class, there is a method providesMappedClasses() containing a list of classes that needs to be serialized/deserialized. We need to add the above model in the list. Then, this list is provided to Singleton instance of JSONAPIConvertorFactory through Dagger. JSONAPIConvertorFactory uses the Retrofit ObjectMapper and maps the classes that are handled by this instance.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Provides<br />\nClass[] providesMappedClasses() {<br />\nreturn new Class[]{Event.class, Attendee.class, Ticket.class, Order.class};<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Further, various serialization properties can be used while building Singleton ObjectMapper instance. Adding any properties here ensures that these are applied to all the mapped classes by JSONAPIConvertorFactory. For eg, we are using the serialization property to throw an exception and fail whenever empty beans are encountered.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Provides<br />\n@Singleton<br />\nObjectMapper providesObjectMapper() {<br />\nreturn new ObjectMapper()<br />\n.disable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES)<br />\n.disable(SerializationFeature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS)<br />\n// Handle constant breaking changes in API by not including null fields<br />\n// TODO: Remove when API stabilizes and/or need to include null values is there<br />\n.setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT);<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Github Repository for jsonapi-converter <a href=\"https://github.com/jasminb/jsonapi-converter\">https://github.com/jasminb/jsonapi-converter</a></li>\n<li>Github repository for Jackson Retrofit Plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/jackson\">https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/jackson</a></li>\n<li>Official Website for Project Lombok <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/\">https://projectlombok.org/</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Github Repository for Open-Event-Orga-App <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app</a></p>\n","published":"2018-08-26T14:28:30.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/serializing-java-objects-for-rest-api-requests-in-open-event-organizer-app/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Adding Preference Settings using Preference Fragment Compat","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment-768x568.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?resize=768%2C568&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?resize=271%2C200&amp;ssl=1 271w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?resize=750%2C554&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?resize=1024%2C757&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?w=1354&amp;ssl=1 1354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17568\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/adding-preference-settings-using-preference-fragment-compat/preference-fragment/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?fit=1354%2C1001&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1354,1001\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"preference fragment\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?fit=750%2C554&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?fit=1024%2C757&amp;ssl=1\" /><p>It is very much likely that one needs to add preferences to their app which span the entire application and therefore can be accessed anywhere in the app without storing anything in database or making global variables. For an instance, in <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">Open Event Organizer App</a> we added the preferences to store the privacy policy, cookie policy etc. The user can access these items in Settings Preference which in device settings. In this blog post we will see how to add preference settings to the app by storing the data in shared preferences.</p>\n<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>\n<p>The benefit of storing the data in shared preference and not in local storage is that the access time for the data is drastically reduced and the data persists even when the app is closed. We will use <a href=\"https://github.com/Gericop/Android-Support-Preference-V7-Fix\">this library</a> which is built on top of official preference-v7 library.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we will make a preference resource layout file and add the preference for privacy policy and cookie policy in the preference screen.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&lt;PreferenceScreen xmlns:android=&#8221;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&#8221;&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;Preference<br />\nandroid:key=&#8221;@string/privacy_policy_key&#8221;<br />\nandroid:title=&#8221;@string/privacy_policy&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;Preference<br />\nandroid:key=&#8221;@string/cookie_policy_key&#8221;<br />\nandroid:title=&#8221;@string/cookie_policy&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;/PreferenceScreen&gt;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Make a separate preference fragment class named LegalPreferenceFragment which extends PreferenceFragmentCompat.

In <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">Open Event Orga App</a>, the Organizer had a choice to switch between viewing Net Sales or Gross Sales in the App’s Dashboard. We decided to use a preference list to allow the user to select between using Net or Gross Sales.</p>\n<p>The benefit of using Preference List and not any other storage media (like SQLite) to store the information is that, Preference List stores the information as key-value pair in SharedPreferences which makes it easy to store and extract small amount of data with strong consistency guarantees and using less time. Let’s move on to the implementation.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>Firstly add the dependency in build.gradle.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>implementation &#8220;com.takisoft.fix:preference-v7:27.1.0.0&#8221;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the preferences layout file, we will use checkboxes.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&lt;PreferenceScreen xmlns:android=&#8221;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&#8221;&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;CheckBoxPreference<br />\nandroid:key=&#8221;@string/gross_sales_key&#8221;<br />\nandroid:title=&#8221;@string/gross_sales&#8221;<br />\nandroid:defaultValue=&#8221;true&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;CheckBoxPreference<br />\nandroid:key=&#8221;@string/net_sales_key&#8221;<br />\nandroid:title=&#8221;@string/net_sales&#8221;<br />\nandroid:defaultValue=&#8221;false&#8221; /&gt;<br />\n&lt;/PreferenceScreen&gt;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We will create SalesDataSettings class which extends PreferenceFragmentCompat and override onCreatePreferenceFix method. We will request PreferenceManager and set SharedPreferencesName. The manager will be used to store and retrieve key-value pairs from SharedPreferences. Using setPreferencesFromResource we will attach the layout file to the fragment.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>PreferenceManager manager = getPreferenceManager();<br />\nmanager.setSharedPreferencesName(Constants.FOSS_PREFS);</p>\n<p>setPreferencesFromResource(R.xml.sales_data_display, rootKey);</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We are using CheckBox Preferences and modifying their behaviour to work as a Radio Preference List because Radio reference is not provided by Android. We are initializing two checkboxes and attaching a preference listener to unset all other checkboxes which one is selected.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>CheckBoxPreference netSales = (CheckBoxPreference) findPreference(NET_SALES);<br />\nCheckBoxPreference grossSales = (CheckBoxPreference) findPreference(GROSS_SALES);</p>\n<p>Preference.OnPreferenceChangeListener listener = (preference, newValue) -&gt; {<br />\nString key = preference.getKey();</p>\n<p>switch (key) {<br />\ncase GROSS_SALES:<br />\nnetSales.setChecked(false);<br />\nbreak;<br />\ncase NET_SALES:<br />\ngrossSales.setChecked(false);<br />\nbreak;<br />\ndefault:<br />\nbreak;<br />\n}<br />\nreturn (Boolean) newValue;<br />\n};</p>\n<p>netSales.setOnPreferenceChangeListener(listener);<br />\ngrossSales.setOnPreferenceChangeListener(listener);</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We can load SalesDataDisplay Fragment class when a preference button is clicked using fragment transactions as shown below.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>findPreference(getString(R.string.sales_data_display_key)).setOnPreferenceClickListener(preference -&gt; {<br />\ngetFragmentManager().beginTransaction()<br />\n.replace(R.id.fragment_container, SalesDataSettings.newInstance())<br />\n.addToBackStack(null)<br />\n.commit();<br />\nreturn true;<br />\n});</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Shared Preferences Documentation <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences\">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences</a></li>\n<li>Gericop Takisoft Android-Support-Preference-V7-Fix <a href=\"https://github.com/Gericop/Android-Support-Preference-V7-Fix\">https://github.com/Gericop/Android-Support-Preference-V7-Fix</a></li>\n<li>Codebase for Open Event Organizer App <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app</a></li>\n</ol>\n","published":"2018-08-26T11:08:24.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/adding-list-preference-settings-using-preference-fragment-compat/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Performing Database Migrations using DbFlow","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow-768x198.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?resize=768%2C198&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?resize=300%2C77&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?resize=750%2C193&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?resize=1024%2C264&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?w=1102&amp;ssl=1 1102w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17559\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/performing-database-migrations-using-dbflow/dbfow/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?fit=1102%2C284&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1102,284\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"dbfow\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?fit=750%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?fit=1024%2C264&amp;ssl=1\" /><p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">Open Event Organizer Android App</a> we decided to add database migrations for every change in database while development. Two of the reasons behind this &#8211;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The users have some version of the app installed and then during development the developers had to modify the database, let’s say, add a table or modify existing ones. This makes the existing database incompatible with the new app. On adding database migration the upgradation of database takes place automatically and prevent the situation of reinstalling the app.</li>\n<li>Migrations makes it possible to rollback or upgrade to some particular database state. Thus, help in debugging certain changes in isolation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s discuss the implementation details. Consider the scenario when a user adds a new table named SpeakersCall. For creating migration for this change we need to add migration class inside OrgaDatabase class annotated with @Database. We will break it down to look closely at each step.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use @Migration annotation in DbFlow library and specify the new database version (by incrementing the existing version) and the database class.</li>\n<li>Extend BaseMigration and override migrate method.</li>\n<li>The logic used inside the migrate method can be different for different tasks. In the present case we first need to delete any existing table (if exists) with the name SpeakersCall and then recreate that table in database.</li>\n<li>Create an array of java classes which are created/modified.</li>\n<li>We wrap the SQL query inside a Database Wrapper class which prevents it from running recursively.</li>\n<li>FlowManager uses reflection to look up and construct the generated database holder class used in defining the structure for all databases used in this application. So we will getModelAdapter for the class to be recreated and use creation query returned by Model Adapter and execute it.</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Migration(version = 15, database = OrgaDatabase.class)<br />\npublic static class MigrationTo15 extends BaseMigration {</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic void migrate(@NonNull DatabaseWrapper databaseWrapper) {<br />\nTimber.d(&#8220;Running migration for DB version 14&#8221;);</p>\n<p>Class&lt;?&gt;[] recreated = new Class[] {SpeakersCall.class};</p>\n<p>for (Class&lt;?&gt; recreate: recreated) {<br />\nModelAdapter modelAdapter = FlowManager.getModelAdapter(recreate);<br />\ndatabaseWrapper.execSQL(DROP_TABLE + modelAdapter.getTableName());<br />\ndatabaseWrapper.execSQL(modelAdapter.getCreationQuery());<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Similarly, we can write migration for changing a column of table(s).</p>\n","published":"2018-08-26T11:02:25.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/performing-database-migrations-using-dbflow/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Testing the ViewModels in Open Event Organizer App","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"417\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit-768x417.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?resize=768%2C417&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?resize=750%2C407&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?w=774&amp;ssl=1 774w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17556\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/testing-the-viewmodels-in-open-event-organizer-app/junit/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?fit=774%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"774,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"junit\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?fit=750%2C407&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?fit=774%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" /><p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">Open Event Organizer Android App</a> we follow Test Driven Development Approach which means the features added in the app are tested thoroughly by unit tests. More tests would ensure better code coverage and fewer bugs. This blog explains how to write tests for Viewmodel class in MVVM architecture.</p>\n<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>\n<p>We will use JUnit4 to write unit tests and Mockito for creating mocks. The OrdersViewModel class returns the list of Order objects to the Fragment class. The objects are requested from OrderRepository class which fetches them from Network and Database. We will create a mock of OrderRepository class since it is out of context and contain logic that doesn’t depend on Orders Respository. Below is the getOrders method that we will test.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> public LiveData&lt;List&lt;Order&gt;&gt; getOrders(long id, boolean reload) {<br />\nif (ordersLiveData.getValue() != null &amp;&amp; !reload)<br />\nreturn ordersLiveData;</p>\n<p>compositeDisposable.add(orderRepository.getOrders(id, reload)<br />\n.compose(dispose(compositeDisposable))<br />\n.doOnSubscribe(disposable -&gt; progress.setValue(true))<br />\n.doFinally(() -&gt; progress.setValue(false))<br />\n.toList()<br />\n.subscribe(ordersLiveData::setValue,<br />\nthrowable -&gt; error.setValue(ErrorUtils.getMessage(throwable).toString())));</p>\n<p>return ordersLiveData;<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We will be using InstantTaskExecutorRule() which is a JUnit Test Rule that swaps the background executor used by the Architecture Components with a different one which executes each task synchronously. We will use setUp() method to load the RxJavaPlugins, RxAndroid plugins and reset them in tearDown method which will ensure each test runs independently from the other and avoid memory leaks. After doing this initialization and basic setup for tests we can begin code the method shouldLoadOrdersSuccessfuly() to test the getOrders method present in ViewModel class. Let’s see the step by step approach.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use Mockito.when to return Observables one by one from ORDERS_LIST whenever the method getOrders of the mock orderRepository is called.</li>\n<li>We will use Mockito.InOrder and pass orders, orderRepository and progress to check if they are called in a particular order.</li>\n<li>We will use .observeForever method to observe on LiveData objects and add a ArrayList on change.</li>\n<li>Finally, we will test and verify if the methods are called in order.</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Test<br />\npublic void shouldLoadOrdersSuccessfully() {<br />\nwhen(orderRepository.getOrders(EVENT_ID, false))<br />\n.thenReturn(Observable.fromIterable(ORDERS_LIST));</p>\n<p>InOrder inOrder = Mockito.inOrder(orders, orderRepository, progress);</p>\n<p>ordersViewModel.getProgress().observeForever(progress);</p>\n<p>orders.onChanged(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;());</p>\n<p>ordersViewModel.getOrders(EVENT_ID, false);</p>\n<p>inOrder.verify(orders).onChanged(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;());<br />\ninOrder.verify(orderRepository).getOrders(EVENT_ID, false);<br />\ninOrder.verify(progress).onChanged(true);<br />\ninOrder.verify(progress).onChanged(false);<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Similar approach can be followed for writing tests to check other behaviour of the ViewModel.</p>\n<h2><b>References</b></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Official Documentation for testing. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/core/executor/testing/InstantTaskExecutorRule\">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/core/executor/testing/InstantTaskExecutorRule</a></li>\n<li>Official Documentation for JUnit.  <a href=\"https://junit.org/junit4/\">https://junit.org/junit4/</a></li>\n<li>Official documentation for Mockito.  <a href=\"http://site.mockito.org/\">http://site.mockito.org/</a></li>\n<li>Open Event Organizer App codebase.  <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app</a></li>\n</ol>\n","published":"2018-08-26T10:57:23.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/testing-the-viewmodels-in-open-event-organizer-app/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Swipe to Check In/Out in Open Event Organizer App","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"455\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check-768x455.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?resize=768%2C455&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?resize=750%2C444&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?resize=1024%2C607&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17553\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/swipe-to-check-in-out-in-open-event-organizer-app/check-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?fit=2500%2C1481&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2500,1481\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"check\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?fit=750%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?fit=1024%2C607&amp;ssl=1\" /><p><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">Open Event Organizer App</a> didn’t provide any option for the Event Organizer to view the list of Attendees present under an Order and check them in/out the event. Therefore, we designed a system such that the Organizer can just swipe the attendee present under an order to check them in or out. In this blog post, I will discuss how we implemented this functionality in Open Event Organizer App without using any third party libraries.</p>\n<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>\n<p>We will create a separate class SwipeController.java which extends ItemTouchHelper.SimpleCallback and provide the swiping functionalities to our plain old recyclerview. We will call the super constructor with ItemTouchHelper.LEFT and ItemTouchHelper.RIGHT as arguments to provide left as well as right movements in each recyclerview list item. The bitmaps and paint object initialized here will be used later in onDraw.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public SwipeController(OrderDetailViewModel orderDetailViewModel, OrderAttendeesAdapter orderAttendeesAdapter, Context context) {<br />\nsuper(0, ItemTouchHelper.LEFT | ItemTouchHelper.RIGHT);<br />\nthis.orderDetailViewModel = orderDetailViewModel;<br />\nthis.orderAttendeesAdapter = orderAttendeesAdapter;</p>\n<p>closeIcon = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(context.getResources(), R.drawable.close);<br />\ndoneIcon = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(context.getResources(), R.drawable.done);</p>\n<p>paintGreen.setColor(context.getResources().getColor(R.color.light_green_500));<br />\npaintRed.setColor(context.getResources().getColor(R.color.red_500));<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Next, we will override getMovementFlags method. This method decides the allowed movement directions for each recyclerview item. The deciding logic is that, if an attendee is checked in then the allowed movement is left to check out and if an attendee is checked out then the allowed movement is right to check in. If neither of the above case, then both movements are allowed.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Override<br />\npublic int getMovementFlags(RecyclerView recyclerView, RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder) {<br />\nint dragFlags = 0;</p>\n<p>If (orderDetailViewModel.getCheckedInStatus(</p>\n<p>viewHolder.getAdapterPosition()) == null)<br />\nmakeMovementFlags(dragFlags, ItemTouchHelper.LEFT | ItemTouchHelper.RIGHT);</p>\n<p>if (orderDetailViewModel.getCheckedInStatus(</p>\n<p>viewHolder.getAdapterPosition())) {<br />\nreturn makeMovementFlags(dragFlags, ItemTouchHelper.LEFT);<br />\n} else {<br />\nreturn makeMovementFlags(dragFlags, ItemTouchHelper.RIGHT);<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The onChildDraw method involves the code doing actual drawing. The variables used in code are discussed below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ActionState &#8211; Checks the state of the recycler view item. We proceed with the below logic if the item is being swiped.</li>\n<li>dX &#8211; The distance by which the item is swiped. Positive for left and negative for right.</li>\n<li>Background &#8211; Background of the viewholder. Rectangular in shape and dimensions changed with change in dX.</li>\n<li>IconDest &#8211; Calculates the position where the icons (close icon or done icon) is placed in canvas</li>\n<li>Canvas &#8211; Java Canvas on which the drawing is done. We set the background and draw the bitmaps on their location in canvas.</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Override<br />\npublic void onChildDraw(Canvas canvas, RecyclerView recyclerView, RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder,<br />\nfloat dX, float dY, int actionState, boolean isCurrentlyActive) {<br />\nif (actionState == ItemTouchHelper.ACTION_STATE_SWIPE) {<br />\nView itemView = viewHolder.itemView;<br />\nfloat height = (float) itemView.getBottom() &#8211; (float) itemView.getTop();<br />\nfloat width = height / 3;<br />\nRectF background;<br />\nPaint paint;<br />\nBitmap icon;<br />\nRectF iconDest;</p>\n<p>if (dX &gt; 0) {<br />\nbackground = new RectF((float) itemView.getLeft(), (float) itemView.getTop(), dX,<br />\n(float) itemView.getBottom());<br />\npaint = paintGreen;<br />\nicon = doneIcon;<br />\niconDest = new RectF((float) itemView.getLeft() + width,<br />\n(float) itemView.getTop() + width, (float) itemView.getLeft() + 2 * width,<br />\n(float) itemView.getBottom() &#8211; width);<br />\n} else {<br />\nbackground = new RectF((float) itemView.getRight() + dX, (float) itemView.getTop(),<br />\n(float) itemView.getRight(), (float) itemView.getBottom());<br />\npaint = paintRed;<br />\nicon = closeIcon;<br />\niconDest = new RectF((float) itemView.getRight() &#8211; 2 * width,<br />\n(float) itemView.getTop() + width, (float) itemView.getRight() &#8211; width,<br />\n(float) itemView.getBottom() &#8211; width);<br />\n}</p>\n<p>canvas.drawRect(background, paint);<br />\ncanvas.drawBitmap(icon, null, iconDest, paint);<br />\n}<br />\nsuper.onChildDraw(canvas, recyclerView, viewHolder, dX, dY, actionState, isCurrentlyActive);<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now after the item is swiped out or in, we need to restore its original state again. For this we override the onSwiped method and call notifyItemChanged(). Also, the changes in UI (showing green side strip for checked in and red side strip for checked out) are done by. We call the toggleCheckin() method in ViewModel to toggle the checking status of the attendee in server and local database.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Override<br />\npublic void onSwiped(RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder, int direction) {<br />\nint position = viewHolder.getAdapterPosition();</p>\n<p>orderDetailViewModel.toggleCheckIn(position);<br />\norderAttendeesAdapter.notifyItemChanged(position);<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Last but not the least, we will override the onMove method to return false. Since we are not supporting drag and drop features therefore this method will never be called.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Override<br />\npublic boolean onMove(RecyclerView recyclerView, RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder, RecyclerView.ViewHolder target) {<br />\nreturn false;<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><b>Resources</b></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Codebase for Open Event Organizer App <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app</a></li>\n<li>Official documentation for ItemTouchHelper.SimpleCallback <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/helper/ItemTouchHelper.SimpleCallback\">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/helper/ItemTouchHelper.SimpleCallback</a></li>\n</ol>\n","published":"2018-08-26T10:51:09.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/swipe-to-check-in-out-in-open-event-organizer-app/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Showing Order Details in Eventyay Organizer Android App","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"553\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/orderscr-768x553.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/orderscr.png?resize=768%2C553&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/orderscr.png?resize=278%2C200&amp;ssl=1 278w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/orderscr.png?resize=750%2C540&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/orderscr.png?resize=1024%2C737&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/orderscr.png?w=1384&amp;ssl=1 1384w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17550\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/showing-order-details-in-eventyay-organizer-android-app/orderscr/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/orderscr.png?fit=1384%2C996&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1384,996\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"orderscr\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/orderscr.png?fit=750%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/orderscr.png?fit=1024%2C737&amp;ssl=1\" /><p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">Open Event Organizer App</a>, the organizer was not able to view the details for the Orders received from attendees for his/her events. So in this blog we’ll see how we implemented this functionality in the Orga App.</p>\n<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>\n<p>There is a fragment showing the list of all orders for that event. The user will be able to click on order from the list which will then take the user to another fragment where Order details will be displayed. We will be following MVVM architecture to implement this functionality using REST API provided by Open Event Server. Let’s get started.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we will create Order Model class. This contains various fields and relationship attributes to setup the table in database using RazizLabs DbFlow annotations.</p>\n<p>Then, We will make a GET request to the server using Retrofit 2  to fetch Order object.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@GET(&#8220;orders/{identifier}?include=event&#8221;)<br />\nObservable&lt;Order&gt; getOrder(@Path(&#8220;identifier&#8221;) String identifier);</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The server will return the Order details in form of a Order object and then we will save it in local  database so that when there is no network connectivity then also we can show data to the user and user can refresh to fetch the latest data from network. The network observable handles fetching data from network and disk observable handles saving data in local database.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@NonNull<br />\n@Override<br />\npublic Observable&lt;Order&gt; getOrder(String orderIdentifier, boolean reload) {<br />\nObservable&lt;Order&gt; diskObservable = Observable.defer(() -&gt;<br />\nrepository<br />\n.getItems(Order.class, Order_Table.identifier.eq(orderIdentifier)).take(1)<br />\n);</p>\n<p>Observable&lt;Order&gt; networkObservable = Observable.defer(() -&gt;<br />\norderApi.getOrder(orderIdentifier)<br />\n.doOnNext(order -&gt; repository<br />\n.save(Order.class, order)<br />\n.subscribe()));</p>\n<p>return repository<br />\n.observableOf(Order.class)<br />\n.reload(reload)<br />\n.withDiskObservable(diskObservable)<br />\n.withNetworkObservable(networkObservable)<br />\n.build();<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now, we will make a Fragment class that will bind the layout file to the model in the onCreateView method using DataBindingUtil. Further, we will be observing on ViewModel to reflect changes of Order, Progress and Error objects in the UI in the onStart method of the Fragment.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public class OrderDetailFragment extends BaseFragment implements OrderDetailView {</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {<br />\nbinding = DataBindingUtil.inflate(inflater, R.layout.order_detail_fragment, container, false);</p>\n<p>orderDetailViewModel = ViewModelProviders.of(this, viewModelFactory).get(OrderDetailViewModel.class);</p>\n<p>return binding.getRoot();<br />\n}</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic void onStart() {<br />\nsuper.onStart();<br />\nsetupRefreshListener();</p>\n<p>orderDetailViewModel.getOrder(orderIdentifier, eventId, false).observe(this, this::showOrderDetails);<br />\norderDetailViewModel.getProgress().observe(this, this::showProgress);<br />\norderDetailViewModel.getError().observe(this, this::showError);<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Next, we will create OrderDetailsViewModel.This is the ViewModel class which interacts with the repository class to get data and the fragment class to show that data in UI.</p>\n<p>Whenever the user opens Order details page, the method getOrder() twill be called which will request an Order object from OrderRepository, wrap it in MutableLiveData and provide it to Fragment.</p>\n<p>Using MutableLiveData to hold the data makes the data reactive i.e. changes in UI are reflected automatically when the object changes. Further, we don’t have to worry handling the screen rotation as LIveData handles it all by itself.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>  public LiveData&lt;Order&gt; getOrder(String identifier, long eventId, boolean reload) {<br />\nif (orderLiveData.getValue() != null &amp;&amp; !reload)<br />\nreturn orderLiveData;</p>\n<p>compositeDisposable.add(orderRepository.getOrder(identifier, reload)<br />\n.compose(dispose(compositeDisposable))<br />\n.doOnSubscribe(disposable -&gt; progress.setValue(true))<br />\n.doFinally(() -&gt; progress.setValue(false))<br />\n.subscribe(order -&gt; orderLiveData.setValue(order),<br />\nthrowable -&gt; error.setValue(ErrorUtils.getMessage(throwable))));</p>\n<p>if (!reload) {<br />\ngetEvent(eventId);<br />\n}</p>\n<p>return orderLiveData;<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><b>References</b></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Codebase for Open Event Orga App <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app</a></li>\n<li>Official documentation for LiveData Architecture Component <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata\">https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata</a></li>\n<li>Official Github Repository of Retrofit  <a href=\"https://github.com/square/retrofit\">https://github.com/square/retrofit</a></li>\n<li>Official Github Repository for RxJava <a href=\"https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava\">https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava</a></li>\n</ol>\n","published":"2018-08-26T10:42:44.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/showing-order-details-in-eventyay-organizer-android-app/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Using Contextual Action Bar as Selection Toolbar","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1-768x1365.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?resize=768%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?resize=113%2C200&amp;ssl=1 113w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?resize=731%2C1300&amp;ssl=1 731w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?resize=1024%2C1820&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17546\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/using-contextual-action-bar-as-selection-toolbar/cont-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?fit=1080%2C1920&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"contextual acion bar\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?fit=731%2C1300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?fit=1024%2C1820&amp;ssl=1\" /><p><b>In </b><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\"><b>Open Event Android Organizer App</b></a> we were using Android Action Bar as Toolbar to allow deleting and editing of the list items but this implementation was buggy and not upto the industry standards. So we decided to implement this using Contextual Action Bar as a selection toolbar.</p>\n<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>\n<p>We are using MVP Architecture so there will be Fragment class to interact with the UI and Presenter class to handle all the business logic and interact with network layer.</p>\n<p>The SessionsFragment is the Fragment class for displaying List of Sessions to the user. We can long press any item to select it, entering into contextual action bar mode. Using this we will be able to select multiple items from list by a click and delete/edit them from toolbar.</p>\n<p>To enter in Contextual Action Bar Mode use</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ActionMode actionMode = getActivity().startActionMode(actionCallback);</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To exit Contextual Action Bar Mode use</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>if (actionMode != null)<br />\nactionMode.finish();</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We will implement Action.Callback interface in out fragment class. It’s contains three method declarations &#8211;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>onCreateActionMode &#8211; This method is executed when the contextual action bar is  created.

In Ember every entity has some predefined set of methods, that it goes through the existence of the application. Route is not different from it. Our main goal is to restore the state of the controller every time we entered into a route, so that we receive a clean and new instance and not the previous state. The hook that fits in the situation is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">setupController()</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This method is called after </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">model()</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> hook to set the controller state in the route. We will restore the variables in the controller here in this method to reset it to original state. This will help in removing the messages and progress on the previous state of the page on a new visit.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Procedure</span></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Open the route, where we want to override the hook, and create a method </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">setupController()</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> this will call the base hook and override its behaviour.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">setupController(controller, model) {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">._super(&#8230;arguments);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">set</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(controller, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;defImages&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, model.def_images);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">set</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(controller, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;user&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, model.user);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">set</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;controller.badgeGenerated&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">false</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">set</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;controller.showProgress&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">false</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> }</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As we can see in the method, it first initialises the super constructor and then we are writing the logic for the reset state.

So instead of showing the user the link of the generated badge on the form, what we can do is that we can send a mail to user with the link of generated badge. However listening for the completion of generated badge from the cloud function is not possible, as cloud functions are based on serverless architecture. This can be done using the listeners for the realtime database events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Generated badge from the backend will be uploaded to the Firebase Storage, but applying a listener for storage events, will not give us the information of the sender and some other metadata.

The problem is that we cannot send a request to an external API from firebase cloud functions in free plan and secondly we have to them bypass the call to realtime database and design a logic to sort out the details from the realtime database using python admin sdk. So, our approach in solving this is that we will use the realtime database with the cloud functions to store the data and using the firebase admin sdk will sort the entries and using binary search will count the statistics efficiently..</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Procedure</span></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Configuring the database URL in admin SDK</span></li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred, {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;storageBucket&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;badgeyay-195bf.appspot.com&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;databaseURL&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;https://badgeyay-195bf.firebaseio.com&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   })</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Write the mail data in realtime database using cloud function on promise resolvement</span></li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>function</b> <b>writeMailData</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(uid, state, reason) {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span> <b>if</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (state === </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;success&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   db.ref(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;mails&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     .push()</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     .set({</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       &#8230;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     }, err =&gt; {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       &#8230;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     });</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> }</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">}</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Fetching the mail data from the realtime database in python admin sdk</span></li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>def</b> <b>get_admin_stat</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">():</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   mail_ref = firebasedb.reference(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;mails&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   mail_resp = mail_ref.get()</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   &#8230;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   curr_date = datetime.datetime.utcnow()</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   prev_month_date = curr_date &#8211; relativedelta(months=1)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   last_three_days_date = curr_date &#8211; relativedelta(days=3)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   last_seven_days_date = curr_date &#8211; relativedelta(days=7)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   last_day_date = curr_date &#8211; relativedelta(days=1)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   &#8230;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This will fetch the current date and them generates the relative dates in past.

We handled this challenge and came up with options to share Event with other social media apps. Along with that user can send Email to users containing event description with just a click. All this through a UI that our user will love interacting with. Let’s see how we implemented this.</p>\n<h2>Specifications</h2>\n<p>We designed a UI given below which offer four functionalities to the user in a single screen.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Event Name and Date are shown in the CardView.</li>\n<li>User can copy Event External URL by clicking on Copy URL option.</li>\n<li>User can send Email containing information about the Event like ( Name, Description, Starting and Ending Date-Time for the Event) via Email by clicking on Email option.</li>\n<li>User can share the same information described in point three via other social media/chatting apps etc by clicking on many more option.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The is the Event Model class ia a POJO containing the associated attributes.</p>\n<p>We will use Retrofit to fetch Event object from server through a GET request in EventApi class.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@GET(&#8220;events/{id}?include=tickets&#8221;)<br />\nObservable&lt;Event&gt; getEvent(@Path(&#8220;id&#8221;) long id);</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Then we will use the getEvent method of EventRepositoryImpl class to make the request for us using EventApi class and then pass on the Response Event object to the ViewModel by wrapping it in RxJava Observable. We are accepting a boolean field named reload which decdes whether we need to reuse the existing Event object from Local Database  or fetch a new object from server.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Override<br />\npublic Observable&lt;Event&gt; getEvent(long eventId, boolean reload) {<br />\nObservable&lt;Event&gt; diskObservable = Observable.defer(() -&gt;<br />\nrepository<br />\n.getItems(Event.class, Event_Table.id.eq(eventId))<br />\n.filter(Event::isComplete)<br />\n.take(1)<br />\n);</p>\n<p>Observable&lt;Event&gt; networkObservable = Observable.defer(() -&gt;<br />\neventApi<br />\n.getEvent(eventId)<br />\n.doOnNext(this::saveEvent));</p>\n<p>return repository.observableOf(Event.class)<br />\n.reload(reload)<br />\n.withDiskObservable(diskObservable)<br />\n.withNetworkObservable(networkObservable)<br />\n.build();<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In ShareEventVewModel, we are calling the getEvent from EventRepositoryImpl class, construct a LiveData object from it so that UI could observe changes on it. Methods getShareableInformation, getShareableUrl, getShareableSubject provide the shareable information to the UI which is further shared with other apps.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public class ShareEventViewModel extends ViewModel {</p>\n<p>protected LiveData&lt;Event&gt; getEvent(long eventId, boolean reload) {<br />\nif (eventLiveData.getValue() != null &amp;&amp; !reload)<br />\nreturn eventLiveData;</p>\n<p>compositeDisposable.add(eventRepository.getEvent(eventId, reload)<br />\n.doOnSubscribe(disposable -&gt; progress.setValue(true))<br />\n.doFinally(() -&gt; progress.setValue(false))<br />\n.subscribe(event -&gt; {<br />\nthis.event = event;<br />\neventLiveData.setValue(event);<br />\n},<br />\nthrowable -&gt; error.setValue(ErrorUtils.getMessage(throwable))));</p>\n<p>return eventLiveData;<br />\n}</p>\n<p>public String getShareableInformation() {<br />\nreturn Utils.getShareableInformation(event);<br />\n}</p>\n<p>}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In ShareEventFragment class does the work of binding the UI to the model using data binding. It observes the LiveData objects supplied by presenter and reflect the changes in UI to the LiveData object.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public class ShareEventFragment extends BaseFragment implements ShareEventView {</p>\n<p>public void shareEvent() {<br />\nIntent shareIntent = new Intent();<br />\nshareIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND);<br />\nshareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, shareEventViewModel.getShareableInformation());<br />\nshareIntent.setType(&#8220;text/plain&#8221;);<br />\nstartActivity(Intent.createChooser(shareIntent, getResources().getText(R.string.send_to)));<br />\n}</p>\n<p>public void shareByEmail() {<br />\nIntent shareIntent = new Intent();<br />\nshareIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SENDTO);<br />\nshareIntent.setType(&#8220;message/rfc822&#8221;);<br />\nshareIntent.setData(Uri.parse(&#8220;mailto:&#8221;));<br />\nshareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, shareEventViewModel.getEmailSubject());<br />\nshareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, shareEventViewModel.getShareableInformation());<br />\ntry {<br />\nstartActivity(Intent.createChooser(shareIntent, getResources().getText(R.string.send_to)));<br />\n} catch (android.content.ActivityNotFoundException ex) {<br />\nViewUtils.showSnackbar(binding.getRoot(), &#8220;There are no email clients installed&#8221;);<br />\n}<br />\n}</p>\n<p>public void copyUrlToClipboard() {<br />\nClipboardManager clipboard = (ClipboardManager) getActivity().getSystemService(Context.CLIPBOARD_SERVICE);<br />\nString eventUrl = shareEventViewModel.getShareableUrl();<br />\nif (eventUrl == null) {<br />\nViewUtils.showSnackbar(binding.getRoot(), &#8220;Event does not have a Public URL&#8221;);<br />\n} else {<br />\nClipData clip = ClipData.newPlainText(&#8220;Event URL&#8221;, shareEventViewModel.getShareableUrl());<br />\nclipboard.setPrimaryClip(clip);<br />\nViewUtils.showSnackbar(binding.getRoot(), &#8220;Event URL Copied to Clipboard&#8221;);<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The layout file contains the Event object bind to the UI using Two way Data Binding.

So, we added a feature to allow users to change their existing password. This blog explains the technical details to implement this feature following MVVM architecture and using highly efficient libraries like Retrofit, RxJava, Raziz Labs DbFlow, Data Binding.</p>\n<h2>Specifications</h2>\n<p>We will implement a page where users can enter their old password and new password along with a confirm password field. Their will be a login button to send the password change request to server. Server then return a response and we will provide feedback regarding the request. We are following MVP architecture so there will be a Model class, Fragment class, Presenter class and Network Layer to make network requests.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with creating ChangePassword model class. There are three fields to store old password, new password and new confirmed password. Several Lombok annotations like @Data, @AllArgsConstructor, @NoArgsConstructor are used to avoid boilerplate code for getters, setters and constructors. @JsonNaming annotation is used to translate the Java Object names to KebabCase when they are serialized.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Data<br />\n@AllArgsConstructor<br />\n@NoArgsConstructor<br />\n@JsonNaming(PropertyNamingStrategy.KebabCaseStrategy.class)<br />\npublic class ChangePassword {</p>\n<p>public String oldPassword;<br />\npublic String newPassword;</p>\n<p>@JsonIgnore<br />\npublic String confirmNewPassword;<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The layout file is binded to model using Data Binding. There will be three TextInputEditText fields for user input. An option to toggle password visibility and a login button.</p>\n<p>The Fragment class binds layout file to the Fragment and handle UI stuff.

It takes as input the changePassword object from Presenter which is already binded with data. Then it uses RxJava to asynchronously call the Api class and pass in the Map&lt;String, ChangePassword&gt; object. The result is then processed and Completable object is returned to the presenter. The Presenter processes the Completable object and shows user feedback in the form of a message in SnackBar.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Official documentation for RxJava by ReactiveX <a href=\"https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava\">https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava</a></li>\n<li>Official documentation for Retrofit by Square Inc <a href=\"https://github.com/square/retrofit\">https://github.com/square/retrofit</a></li>\n<li>Codebase for Open Event Organizer App on Github <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app</a></li>\n<li>Open Event Server deployment at heroku <a href=\"https://open-event-api-dev.herokuapp.com/\">https://open-event-api-dev.herokuapp.com/</a></li>\n</ol>\n","published":"2018-08-25T18:21:30.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/change-password-feature-for-open-event-android-organizer-app/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Create Session in Open Event Android Organizer Application","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"455\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/session-768x455.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/session.jpg?resize=768%2C455&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/session.jpg?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/session.jpg?resize=750%2C444&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/session.jpg?resize=1024%2C607&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/session.jpg?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17520\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/create-session-in-open-event-android-organizer-application/session/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/session.jpg?fit=2500%2C1481&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2500,1481\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"session\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/session.jpg?fit=750%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/session.jpg?fit=1024%2C607&amp;ssl=1\" /><p><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\"><b>Open Event Android Organizer Application</b></a> offered variety of features to Organizers from all over the world to help them host their Events globally but it didn’t had the functionality to create Sessions in the app itself and associate it to Tracks. This feature addition was crucial since it enables Organizer to create Sessions which every common person enquires about before attending and event. In this Blog Post we will see how we added this functionality in the app.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\"><b>Open Event Android Organizer Application</b></a> is a client for <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server\"><b>Open Event Server</b></a> which provides the REST API.</p>\n<h2>Problem</h2>\n<p>There can be various Sessions associated with Tracks for an Event. <a href=\"https://open-event-api-dev.herokuapp.com/\"><b>Open Event API</b></a> had the endpoint to implement Creating Session but the Orga app didn’t, so we worked on creating a Session in the app.</p>\n<p>The UI for creating a Session is shown above. User can fill in the necessary details and click on the green Floating Action Button to create a Session.</p>\n<h2>How to implement functionality?</h2>\n<p>We will follow MVP Architecture and use Retrofit 2.x, RxJava, Dagger, Jackson, Data Binding and other industry standard libraries to implement this functionality.</p>\n<p>Firstly, let’s create Session model class specifying the attributes and relationships to set up in database using RazizLabs DbFlow library. The POJO will be serialized into JSON by Jackson library to be passed on as a part of RequestBody to server.</p>\n<p>Now we will create SessionApi class that will contain the request details to be passed to Retrofit. <b>@POST</b> denotes a POST request and <b>@Body</b> denotes the requestBody of the request which is a Session object.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public interface SessionApi {<br />\n@POST(&#8220;sessions&#8221;)<br />\nObservable&lt;Session&gt; postSession(@Body Session session);<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This is the CreateSessionFragment class that contains the code binding model to the view. The Fragment class implements the CreateSessionView class overriding the method declarations present there. The <b>@Inject</b> annotation of Dagger is used to load singleton presenter instance lazily to improve app’s performance.</p>\n<p>Event-Id and Track-Id’s are retrieved from Bundle from Fragment Transaction. These are then passed on to presenter when Create Session button is pressed. There are other methods to show binding progressbar, snackbar and other UI components to show progress of the background request to server and database.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public class CreateSessionFragment extends BaseFragment&lt;CreateSessionPresenter&gt; implements CreateSessionView {</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup</p>\n<p>container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {<br />\nbinding = DataBindingUtil.inflate(inflater,</p>\n<p>R.layout.session_create_layout, container, false);<br />\nvalidator = new Validator(binding.form);</p>\n<p>binding.sessionCreate.setOnClickListener(view -&gt; {<br />\nif (validator.validate()) {<br />\ngetPresenter().createSession(trackId, eventId);<br />\n}<br />\n});</p>\n<p>return binding.getRoot();<br />\n}</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic void onStart() {<br />\nsuper.onStart();<br />\ngetPresenter().attach(this);<br />\nbinding.setSession(getPresenter().getSession());<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the Presenter createSession method is called when create button is pressed in UI. The method attaches track-id and event-id to Session object. This is necessary for Relationship constraints on Session Model. Then after binding all the data to Session object, we pass it on to SessionRepository. The success response is provided to user by passing success response in getView().onSuccess() method.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public class CreateSessionPresenter extends</p>\n<p>AbstractBasePresenter&lt;CreateSessionView&gt; {</p>\n<p>public Session getSession() {<br />\nreturn session;<br />\n}</p>\n<p>public void createSession(long trackId, long eventId) {</p>\n<p>Track track = new Track();<br />\nEvent event = new Event();</p>\n<p>track.setId(trackId);<br />\nevent.setId(eventId);<br />\nsession.setTrack(track);<br />\nsession.setEvent(event);</p>\n<p>sessionRepository<br />\n.createSession(session)<br />\n.compose(dispose(getDisposable()))<br />\n.compose(progressiveErroneous(getView()))<br />\n.subscribe(createdSession -&gt;</p>\n<p>getView().onSuccess(&#8220;Session Created&#8221;), Logger::logError);<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The SessionRepository uses <b>RxJava</b> to make asynchronous <b>Retrofit</b> Call to Server. We throw a Network Error to user if the device does not have Internet Connectivity.</p>\n<p>The session object accepted as a parameter in createSession method is passed on to sessionApi. It will return Observable&lt;Session&gt; Response which we will process in doOnNext() method. Then the Session object along with required foreign key relationships with Track and Event is saved in database for offline use.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Override<br />\npublic Observable&lt;Session&gt; createSession(Session session) {<br />\nif (!repository.isConnected()) {<br />\nreturn Observable.error(new Throwable(Constants.NO_NETWORK));<br />\n}return sessionApi<br />\n.postSession(session)<br />\n.doOnNext(created -&gt; {<br />\ncreated.setTrack(session.getTrack());<br />\ncreated.setEvent(session.getEvent());<br />\nrepository<br />\n.save(Session.class, created)<br />\n.subscribe();<br />\n})<br />\n.subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())<br />\n.observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread());<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The above code snippets are from Open Event Orga Application.

style=\"font-weight: 400\">SUSI Smart Speaker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is an Open Source speaker with many exciting features. The user needs an Android or iOS device to set up the speaker. You can refer </span><a href=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/initial-setups-for-connecting-susi-smart-speaker-with-iphone-ipad/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for initial connection to SUSI Smart Speaker. In this post, we will see how a user can connect SUSI Smart Speaker to iOS devices (iPhone/iPad).</span></p>\n<p><b>Implementation &#8211;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first step is to detect whether an iOS device connects to SUSI.AI hotspot or not. For this, we match the currently connected wifi SSID with SUSI.AI hotspot SSID. If it matches, we show the connected device in Device Activity to proceed further with setups.</span></p>\n<p><b>Choosing Room &#8211;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Room name is basically the location of your SUSI Smart Speaker in the home. You may have multiple SUSI Smart Speaker in different rooms, so the purpose of adding the room is to differentiate between them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the user clicks on Wi-Fi displayed cell, it starts the initial setups. We are using </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><code>didSelectRowAt</code></span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> method of <code>UITableViewDelegate</code> to get which cell is selected. On clicking the displayed Wi-Fi cell, a popup is open with a Room Location Text field.</span></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em

The blog will solve the difficult task of communication between two fragments of a single activity. For passing data between multiple fragments of different activities, refer to [1].</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How to pass data between fragments?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this blog, I will pass data from Fragment 2 to Fragment 1 only.

The demonstration will be purely from the work I have done under PR </span><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-android/pull/1355\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">#1355</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in </span><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-android\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PSLab Android</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> repository.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why prevent the Activity from operating?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When using Bottom Sheet in Android, it is preferable to dim the screen behind the Bottom Sheet to provide a good user experience. But the dimming of the screen is itself an indication that the screen won’t work. Also, if the Bottom Sheet is open and while sliding it, if, by mistake, any button in the background of the bottom sheet gets pressed, then if the function related to that button starts executing then it can create a bad user experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, in PSLab Android app, in Accelerometer instrument, there are record/pause and delete buttons in the toolbar as shown in figure 1. Now, if the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">bottom sheet is opened and while closing it if the delete button is by mistake pressed by the user, then whole recorded data gets deleted. Thus, it’s a good practice to prevent the background Activity from operating while Bottom Sheet is opened.</span></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"17477\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/prevent-android-activity-from-operating-while-using-bottom-sheet-in-pslab-app/screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27.png?fit=327%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"327,582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Accelerometer Instrument in PSLab Android app\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27.png?fit=327%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27.png?fit=327%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-17477 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27.png?resize=327%2C582&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"327\" height=\"582\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27.png?w=327&amp;ssl=1 327w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27.png?resize=112%2C200&amp;ssl=1 112w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 1.

major bug, it required to first detect the barometer instrument and then implementing an alert dialog-box showing that barometer sensor is not present in his device.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Detecting the Barometer Sensor[2]</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The barometer sensor was detected using the sensorManager class of Java</p>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color: #a9b7c6;background: #282b2e none repeat scroll

sensorManager.getDefaultSensor(Sensor.TYPE_PRESSURE) : null;\r\n</pre>\n<p>Thus using this code the barometer sensor is detected, if sensor was not present the  sensorManger would be null.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Implementing the alert-box[1]</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus if the sensorManger variable was null it notified that the sensor was not present in           the device and corresponding to which an alert-box was implemeneted</p>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color: #a9b7c6;background: #282b2e none repeat scroll 0% 0%;padding: 0.5em\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\"

      }).show();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });</pre>\n<p>Thus as we can see in the code snippet the alert dialog-box will appear if  sensor is not present as shown in figure

Lab</a> Android app has got various functionality such as voltmeter, resistance measurement, capacitance measurement, frequency measurement as well as Count pulse measurement , one of the missing functionality among these is the Ammeter, currently in PSLab there is no direct way of measuring current. In this blog I will be discussing an indirect method of measuring current in PSLab.</p>\n<h2>Basics of measuring current</h2>\n<p>Generally in all multimeters , current is measured using  an Ammeter which uses the property of galvanometer to measure to measure current in PSLab. But as the PSLab doesn’t has any such embedded Galvanometer we cannot have a seperate Ammeter in it, but there is another method to measure the current, which is using the famous OHm’s law i.e V/I = R</p>\n<p>In PSLab we can measure the voltage across any elements, plus we can also measure  the resistance of any circuit element in PSLab, the theory used for measuring current is stated as follows.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We connect the current-source to any known resistant(or any resistance) and then measure the voltage across the resistor.</li>\n<li>Finally using<b> ohm’s law </b>the current will be <b>voltage / resistance</b>.[2]</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step-by-step guide on measuring the current</h2>\n<p>Here is the step by step guide on how to measure the current in PSLab:-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take any arbitrary resistor and measure it’s resistance. To measure the resistance follow these steps :-\n<ol>\n<li>Take a resistance and connect it to any two pins of breadboard</li>\n<li>Connect one end to the sen pin and the other end to the GND pin of PSLab device.</li>\n<li>Now go to the Android app and select multimeter instrument.</li>\n<li>Now in the multimeter instrument set the knob to resistance, in the measure section</li>\n<li>Now click on the read button and then it will show the resistance of the resistor</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Now that you have measured the resistance of the resistor, now connect the current source across the resistors.</li>\n<li>Now finally measure the voltage across the resistor. To measure the voltage follow these steps.\n<ol>\n<li>Take two male to male wires and connect it’s two individual ends to the two ends of the resistor.</li>\n<li>Now connect one of the other two ends of the wire to the any one of the CH1, CH2 or CH3 and the other end to GND respectively.</li>\n<li>Now go to the Android app and select multimeter instrument.</li>\n<li>Now in the multimeter instrument set the knob to the channel which you have selected i.e CH1, CH2 or CH3 , in the voltage section.</li>\n<li>Now click on the read button and then it will show the voltage across the resistor.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Now using the using<b> ohm’s law </b>the current will be <b>voltage / resistance</b>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus using these steps one can find the current in PSLab Android App.</p>\n<h2>Images for the Experiment</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img data-attachment-id=\"17433\"

Lab</a> Android app has various functionalities implemented in it, one of the major implemented functionalities is the knob in the multimeter, In my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IU_lpdt4sHI4euM543bBlHwYpv8vwwjxoB76sW1i5HA/edit?usp=sharing\">previous blog </a>I have mentioned about the knobs and how exactly it has been implemented, one the major problems in the knob is that it doesn’t fits correctly in all layouts, even though constraint layout is used , as it has different text-views positioned in a circular constraint in which exact circular radius has to be mentioned (which cannot be constrained), mentioned in my previous-blog there comes the idea of creating different layouts for different-screens in android.</p>\n<h3>Need to create multiple layouts for different screen</h3>\n<p>There arises this question of the use of creating multiple layouts for different screens when you can create a flexible layout using tools such as constraint layout. The answer to this question is that in some cases such as as the case of circular constraint or using a linear-layout  one has to use use hard-coded dimensions which thus makes difference in various screens on, there comes the need of using size and orientation quantifiers i.e making layout according to screen sizes.

rotary knob using an open source library, this blog will be about the new user interface (UI) of multimeter in the <a href=\"https://github.com/abhinavraj23/pslab-android\">PSLab Android app</a>, how a custom rotary knob is implemented in it and how how the text views are positioned circular in them.</p>\n<p><b>Implementation of Custom Rotary Knob </b></p>\n<p>In the PSLab device  the rotary knob is implemented using the BeppiMenozzi Knob library[1] as by doing this we don’t have to manually create the extra class for the knob and we don’t have to write the code from scratch.</p>\n<p><img

It has the following variables:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Subject: The subject of the notification. E.g. ‘event’, ‘order’ etc.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">actionType: The action that can be taken by the user for that notification. E.g: ‘view’, ‘submit’.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">subjectId: The id of the subject. In case of an event, it will store the event id. Similarly for other cases.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Link: The link to be applied to the button. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">import</span> <span style=\"color: #0e84b5;font-weight: bold\">attr</span> <span style=\"color: #0e84b5;font-weight: bold\">from</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'ember-data/attr'</span>;\r\n<span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">import</span> <span style=\"color: #0e84b5;font-weight: bold\">ModelBase</span> <span style=\"color: #0e84b5;font-weight: bold\">from</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'open-event-frontend/models/base'</span>;\r\n<span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">import</span> { belongsTo } <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">from</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'ember-data/relationships'</span>;\r\n\r\nexport default ModelBase<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>extend({\r\n  subject    : attr(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'string'</span>),\r\n  actionType : attr(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'string'</span>),\r\n  subjectId  : attr(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'number'</span>),\r\n  link       : attr(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'string'</span>),\r\n\r\n  notification: belongsTo(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'notification'</span>)\r\n});\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Action Button Title</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We make use of ember computed property to determine the action button title. The title of the button depends on the subject and the actionType defined in the notification-action model. The actionType can be one of ‘download’, ‘submit’ and ‘view’. If the action type is ‘download’ and the subject is ‘invoice’, then the button title will be “Download Invoice”. Similarly, for other cases, we do the same.</span></p>\n<p><!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\">buttonTitle: computed(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'subject'</span>, <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'actionType'</span>, function() {\r\n    let action;\r\n    const actionType <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> this<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>get(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'actionType'</span>);\r\n    switch (actionType) {\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'download'</span>:\r\n        action <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'Download'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'submit'</span>:\r\n        action <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'Submit'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      default:\r\n        action <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'View'</span>;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    let buttonSubject;\r\n    const subject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> this<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>get(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'subject'</span>);\r\n    switch (subject) {\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'event-export'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Event'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'event'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Event'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'invoice'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Invoice'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'order'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Order'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'tickets-pdf'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Tickets'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'event-role'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Invitation Link'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'session'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Session'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'call-for-speakers'</span>:\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">if</span> (this<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>get(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'actionType'</span>) <span style=\"color: #333333\">===</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'submit'</span>) {\r\n          buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Proposal'</span>;\r\n        } <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">else</span> {\r\n          buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Call for Speakers'</span>;\r\n        }\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      default:\r\n        <span style=\"color: #333333\">//</span> Nothing here<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">return</span> action <span style=\"color: #333333\">+</span> buttonSubject;\r\n  })\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Action Button Route</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The route that the button will lead to depends on the subject of the action.

style=\"text-align: center\"> Figure 2.  Showing CAP pins in PSLab</p>\n<p>For measuring capacitance in PSLab we use a specific method in which we supply a constant current to the CAP pin and thus we charge the capacitor to the maximum level, the math involved in it is as follow:-</p>\n<p>We know that</p>\n<p><b><i>Q{charge stored} = C*V</i></b></p>\n<p>Also</p>\n<p><b><i>Q= I * time</i></b></p>\n<p>Where</p>\n<p><b><i>I=current (constant)</i></b></p>\n<p>Thus the capacitance</p>\n<p><b><i>C = Q / V </i></b></p>\n<p>Therefore</p>\n<p><b><i>C = I*time / V (measured). &#8211; (1)</i></b></p>\n<p>Therefore we know the current supplied, we know the voltage measured and we have also set the time to charge the capacitor and thus we get the capacitance from equation (1).</p>\n<p><b>Code implementation for measuring capacitance</b></p>\n<p>This is the primary code for getting the data for measuring capacitance in which we pass the current range and the current time through which the data gets fetched from the device which is then further processed in another function in which we finally get the capacitance.</p>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color:

the error was caused while fetching the incorrect data from the device and processing it. The device gives a negative one value when there is any error in capacitance measurement  and that was being processed, thus the error was solved by introducing a do while loop as shown</p>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color: #a9b7c6;background: #282b2e none repeat scroll 0% 0%;padding: 0.5em\"> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">do</span> <span class=\"hljs-type\" style=\"color: #ffc66d\">VCode</span> = mPacketHandler.getVoltageSummation();\r\n <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">while</span> (<span class=\"hljs-type\" style=\"color: #ffc66d\">VCode</span> == -<span class=\"hljs-number\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">1</span>);</pre>\n<p>And thus now only the correct data fetched is processed further and thus the bug was solved after which the capacitance measurement was correct.</p>\n<h2><b>Resources</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction to Capacitors, electronics-tutorials.ws<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/capacitor/cap_1.html\">https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/capacitor/cap_1.html</a></li>\n<li>How to establish communication between android device and usb, coderanch.com<br />\n<a href=\"https://coderanch.com/t/622740/establish-communication-android-device-usb\">https://coderanch.com/t/622740/establish-communication-android-device-usb</a></li>\n<li>Pull request #1154, Solve capacitance bugs<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-android/pull/1154\">https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-android/pull/1154</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","published":"2018-08-24T12:59:57.000Z","author":"abhinavraj23","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/measuring-capacitor-in-pslab-and-its-bugs/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Onsite Attendee in Open Event Server","content":"<img width=\"448\" height=\"424\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/counter.309880_960_720.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/counter.309880_960_720.jpg?w=448&amp;ssl=1 448w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/counter.309880_960_720.jpg?resize=211%2C200&amp;ssl=1 211w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px\" data-attachment-id=\"17410\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/onsite-attendee-in-open-event-server/counter-309880_960_720/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/counter.309880_960_720.jpg?fit=448%2C424&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"448,424\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"counter.309880_960_720\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/counter.309880_960_720.jpg?fit=448%2C424&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/counter.309880_960_720.jpg?fit=448%2C424&amp;ssl=1\" /><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The </span><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server\"><b>Open Event Server</b></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">enables organizers to manage events from concerts to conferences and meetups. It offers features for events with several tracks and venues. The Event organizers may add orders on behalf of others and accept payments onsite. This blog post goes over the implementation of the onsite attendee feature in the Open Event Server.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Route</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Normally we expect the payload for a POST request of order to contain already created attendees also. In this case we want to create the attendees internally inside the server. Hence we need some way to differentiate between the two types of orders. The most basic and easy to implement option is to use a query parameter to specify if the attendees are onsite or not. We use </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">?onsite=true </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in order to specify that the attendees are onsite and hence should be created internally.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the POST request, we check if the query parameters contains the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">onsite</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> param as true or not. If it is true then we create the attendees using a helper function. The helper function will be discussed in detail later in the article.</span></p>\n<p><!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #888888\"># Create on site attendees.</span>\r\n<span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">if</span> request<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>args<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>get(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'onsite'</span>, <span style=\"color: #007020\">False</span>):\r\n    create_onsite_attendees_for_order(data)\r\n<span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">elif</span> data<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>get(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'on_site_tickets'</span>):\r\n    <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">del</span> data[<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'on_site_tickets'</span>]\r\nrequire_relationship([<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'ticket_holders'</span>], data)\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">OnsiteTicketSchema</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In order to create attendees on the server, we need the information about each ticket bought and it’s quantity.

This blogs will give a brief description of the channel communication error and how was it solved by me.</p>\n<p>In the previous blog I have discussed about the channel communication of PSLab and how it works. In this blog i will be discussing about the channel communication error which was occuring while using CH1 and CH2 pins of PSLab android.</p>\n<p><b>Communication between PSLab device and Android App</b></p>\n<p>As discussed in the previous blog the communication between the PSLab and the android occurs with the help of the USBManger class of android.</p>\n<p>One of the major function which makes it possible is the bulk transfer function of the android</p>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color: #a9b7c6;background: #282b2e none repeat scroll 0% 0%;padding: 0.5em\"><span class=\"hljs-attr\">amtWritten</span> = mConnection.bulkTransfer(mWriteEndpoint, src, written, writeLength, timeoutMillis);</pre>\n<p>As shown in the above code, there is a timeout that some time required for this function to be executed, and otherwise this function will return a negative value which will mean that the communication is not successful.</p>\n<p><b>Voltage Measuring Functions</b></p>\n<p>The main function which gets called while pressing the button for measuring voltage is the getVoltage function which simultaneously calls the volmeterAutoRange function as well as the getAverage voltage function. The voltageAutoRnge function also calls the getAverage function inside of it.</p>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color: #a9b7c6;background: #282b2e none repeat scroll 0% 0%;padding: 0.5em\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">public</span> double getVoltage(String channelName, Integer sample) {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.voltmeterAutoRange(channelName);\r\n    double Voltage = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.getAverageVoltage(channelName, sample);\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">if</span> (channelName.equals(<span class=\"hljs-string\" style=\"color: #6a8759\">\"CH3\"</span>)) {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">return</span> Voltage;\r\n    } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">else</span> {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">2</span> * Voltage;\r\n    }\r\n}</pre>\n<p>Calling both these functions simultaneously results in calling of the bulktranfer method</p>\n<p>VoltmeterAutoRange function:-</p>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color: #a9b7c6;background: #282b2e none repeat scroll 0% 0%;padding: 0.5em\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">private</span> double voltmeterAutoRange(String channelName) {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">if</span> (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.analogInputSources.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">get</span>(channelName).gainPGA == <span class=\"hljs-number\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">0</span>)\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">0</span>;\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.setGain(channelName, <span class=\"hljs-number\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">0</span>, <span class=\"hljs-literal\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">true</span>);\r\n    double V = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.getAverageVoltage(channelName, <span class=\"hljs-literal\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">null</span>);\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.autoSelectRange(channelName, V);\r\n}</pre>\n<p>The getAverage voltage function calls the getRawableVoltage function which thus calls the USBManger class functions of read and write, thus calling the bulkTranfer function.</p>\n<p>Thus as the bulk transfer function is called simultaneously it caused problem in communication.</p>\n<p><b>Solving the issue</b></p>\n<p>The communication related  issues were finally solved when these bugs were spotted, the solution to this issue is that the voltageAutoRange function’s return value was never used in the codes and was thus not required.[2]The voltageAutoRange function was calling the getAverageVoltage function just to get a return value. Thus I formatted the function and now it looks like this-</p>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color: #a9b7c6;background: #282b2e none repeat scroll 0% 0%;padding: 0.5em\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">private</span> void voltmeterAutoRange(String channelName) {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">if</span> (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.analogInputSources.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">get</span>(channelName).gainPGA != <span class=\"hljs-number\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">0</span>) {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.setGain(channelName, <span class=\"hljs-number\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">0</span>, <span class=\"hljs-literal\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">true</span>);\r\n    }\r\n}</pre>\n<p>And thus finally the issue was solved and all things were working fine in channel communication.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li>How to establish communication between android device and usb, coderanch.com<br />\n<a href=\"https://coderanch.com/t/622740/establish-communication-android-device-usb\">https://coderanch.com/t/622740/establish-communication-android-device-usb</a></li>\n<li>Android bulkTransfer return -1, StackOverflow<br />\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15963402/bulktransfer-returns-1\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15963402/bulktransfer-returns-1</a></li>\n<li>Pull request #1066, Solve communication issues in CH1 and CH2<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-android/pull/1066\">https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-android/pull/1066</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","published":"2018-08-24T12:23:53.000Z","author":"abhinavraj23","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/channel-communications-error-of-pslab/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Pop-Up in Meilix Generator","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"476\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image7-2-768x476.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image7-2.png?resize=768%2C476&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image7-2.png?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image7-2.png?resize=750%2C464&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image7-2.png?resize=1024%2C634&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image7-2.png?resize=825%2C510&amp;ssl=1 825w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image7-2.png?w=1460&amp;ssl=1 1460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17383\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/pop-up-in-meilix-generator/image7-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image7-2.png?fit=1460%2C904&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1460,904\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image7-2.png?fit=750%2C464&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image7-2.png?fit=1024%2C634&amp;ssl=1\" /><p><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/meilix-generator\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meilix Generator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> has fields which the user needs to fill up.

The system supports two inbuilt roles namely Admin and Super Admin. The users having access to permissions panel can create new custom system roles and define set of panel permissions for them. Also the users are provided with the option of editing and deleting any system role except the two inbuilt system roles. The feature is implemented using custom-system-roles and panel-permissions API on the server.</p>\n<h2><b>Adding route for system-roles</b></h2>\n<p>The route for custom-system-system roles is defined which contains a model returning user permissions, system roles and the panel permissions. The model is defined as async so that the execution is paused while fetching the data from the store by adding the await expression.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\">async model() {\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">return</span> {\r\n   userPermissions  : await <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'store'</span>).findAll(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'user-permission'</span>),\r\n   systemRoles      : await <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'store'</span>).findAll(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'custom-system-role'</span>),\r\n   panelPermissions : await <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'store'</span>).findAll(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'panel-permission'</span>)\r\n };\r\n},\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>The route created above gets all the data for user permissions, system-roles and panel permissions which is later used by the template for rendering of data.</p>\n<h2><b>Adding model for system-roles and panel-permissions</b></h2>\n<p>The model for system-roles is created which contains the ‘name’ attribute of type string and a relationship with panel permissions. Every system role can have multiple panel permissions, therefore a hasMany relationship is defined in the model.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">export</span> <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">default</span> ModelBase.extend({\r\n name: attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'string'</span>),\r\n\r\n panelPermissions: hasMany(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'panelPermission'</span>)\r\n});\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>Similarly, the model for panel-permissions is added to the models directory. The defined model contains ‘panelName’ as an attribute of type string and a bool value canAccess, defining if the panel is accessible by any role or not.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">export</span> <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">default</span> ModelBase.extend({\r\n panelName : attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'string'</span>),\r\n canAccess : attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'boolean'</span>)\r\n});\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<h2><b>Defining controller for system-roles</b></h2>\n<p>The controller for system-roles is defined in the controllers/admin/permissions directory. The action for adding, updating and deleting system roles are defined in the controller. While adding the system roles, all the panels are fetched and checked which panel permissions are selected by the admin. A special property namely ‘isChecked’ is added to every panel permission checkbox which toggles on change. If the property is set true the corresponding panel is added to the panel permissions relationship of corresponding role. If no panel is selected, an error message to select atleast one panel is displayed.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\">deleteSystemRole(role) {\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.set(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'isLoading'</span>, <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">true</span>);\r\n role.destroyRecord()\r\n  ...\r\n  <span style=\"color: #008000\">// Notify success or failure</span>\r\n},\r\naddSystemRole() {\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.set(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'isLoading'</span>, <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">true</span>);\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">let</span> panels = <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'panelPermissions'</span>);\r\n\r\n panels.forEach(panel =&gt; {\r\n   <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">if</span> (panel.isChecked) {\r\n     <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'role.panelPermissions'</span>).addObject(panel);\r\n   } <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">else</span> {\r\n     <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'role.panelPermissions'</span>).removeObject(panel);\r\n   }\r\n });\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">if</span> (!<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'role.panelPermissions'</span>).length) {\r\n  <span style=\"color: #008000\">// Notification to select atleast one panel</span>\r\n } <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">else</span> {\r\n   <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'role'</span>).save()\r\n    <span style=\"color: #008000\">// Notify success or failure</span>\r\n }\r\n},\r\nupdatePermissions() {\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.set(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'isLoading'</span>, <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">true</span>);\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'model.userPermissions'</span>).save()\r\n  ...\r\n  <span style=\"color: #008000\">// Notify success or failure</span>\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>The actions defined above in the controller can be used in template by passing the appropriate parameters if required. The addSystemRole action makes a POST request to server for creating a new system role, the updatePermissions action makes a PATCH request for updating the existing system role and the deleteSystemRole action makes a delete request to the server for deleting the role.</p>\n<h2><b>Adding data to template for system-roles</b></h2>\n<p>The data obtained from the model defined in route is rendered in the template for system-roles.

Every role has certain set of permissions such as Create, Read, Update, Delete. The Admin of the system is allowed to change the permissions for any role. The interface for updating the even role permissions was already available on the server but was not integrated on the frontend. The system is now integrated with the API and allows admin to change event role permission for any role.</p>\n<h2><b>Adding model for event role permissions</b></h2>\n<p>The model for event role permissions is added to the models directory. The model contains the attributes like canDelete, canUpdate, canCreate, canRead and the relationship with event role and the service.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">export</span> <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">default</span> ModelBase.extend({\r\n canDelete : attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'boolean'</span>),\r\n canUpdate : attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'boolean'</span>),\r\n canCreate : attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'boolean'</span>),\r\n canRead   : attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'boolean'</span>),\r\n\r\n role        : belongsTo(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'role'</span>),\r\n service     : belongsTo(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'service'</span>),\r\n serviceName : computed.alias(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'service.name'</span>)\r\n});\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>The above defined model ensures that every permission belongs to a role and service. An alias is declared in the model using the computed property which is later used in the controller to sort the permissions according to service name in lexicographical order.</p>\n<h2><b>Adding route for event roles</b></h2>\n<p>The route for event role is created which contains model returning an object containing the list of roles, services and permissions. The model is defined as async so that the execution is paused while fetching the data from the store by adding the await expression.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">export</span> <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">default</span> Route.extend({\r\n titleToken() {\r\n   <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">return</span> <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'l10n'</span>).t(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Event Roles'</span>);\r\n },\r\n async model() {\r\n   <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">return</span> {\r\n     roles       : [<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Attendee'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Co-organizer'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Moderator'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Organizer'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Track Organizer'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Registrar'</span>],\r\n     services    : await <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'store'</span>).query(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'service'</span>, {}),\r\n     permissions : await <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'store'</span>).query(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'event-role-permission'</span>, { <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'page[size]'</span>: 30 })\r\n   };\r\n }\r\n});\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>The route created above queries the data for roles, services and permissions which is later used by the template for rendering of the data obtained.</p>\n<h2><b>Adding controller for event roles</b></h2>\n<p>The controller for event roles is added to the controllers/admin/permissions directory.

Every role is fetched from the model and added to the template, all the permissions in sorted order are obtained from the controller and matched with the current role name. The relationship of permissions with role is used to check if its title is equal to the the current role. The permissions are updated accordingly, if the role title is equal to current role.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\">&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n {{<span style=\"border: 1px solid #FF0000\">#</span>each model.roles as |role|}}\r\n   &lt;tr&gt;\r\n     &lt;td&gt;{{role}}&lt;<span style=\"border: 1px solid #FF0000\">/td&gt;</span>\r\n     {{<span style=\"border: 1px solid #FF0000\">#</span>each permissions as |permission|}}\r\n       {{<span style=\"border: 1px solid #FF0000\">#</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">if</span> (eq permission.role.titleName role)}}\r\n         &lt;td&gt;\r\n           {{ui-checkbox label=(t <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Create'</span>) checked=permission.canCreate onChange=(action (mut permission.canCreate))}}\r\n           &lt;br&gt;\r\n           {{ui-checkbox label=(t <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Read'</span>) checked=permission.canRead onChange=(action (mut permission.canRead))}}\r\n           &lt;br&gt;\r\n           {{ui-checkbox label=(t <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Update'</span>) checked=permission.canUpdate onChange=(action (mut permission.canUpdate))}}\r\n           &lt;br&gt;\r\n           {{ui-checkbox label=(t <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Delete'</span>) checked=permission.canDelete onChange=(action (mut permission.canDelete))}}\r\n         &lt;<span style=\"border: 1px solid #FF0000\">/td&gt;</span>\r\n       {{<span style=\"border: 1px solid #FF0000\">/if}}</span>\r\n     {{<span style=\"border: 1px solid #FF0000\">/each}}</span>\r\n   &lt;<span style=\"border: 1px solid #FF0000\">/tr&gt;</span>\r\n {{<span style=\"border: 1px solid #FF0000\">/each}}</span>\r\n&lt;<span style=\"border: 1px solid #FF0000\">/tbody&gt;</span>\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>After rendering the data as shown above, the checkbox for permissions of different services for different roles are checked or unchecked depending upon the bool value of corresponding permission.

Earlier it supported the download of list-view only, now it provides the support to download calendar-view as well. The problem incurred while downloading the calendar-view was that the view gets cropped due to limitations with the library used for PDF generation, thus only some parts of the calendar remained in the PDF. The problem is resolved by creating an image for every date in the schedule and adding the generated image to the PDF.</p>\n<h2><b>Selecting and adding the data for PDF generation</b></h2>\n<p>The data to be added to PDF depending on the filters and date-selectors applied is chosen from the DOM. Selection of data is done by looping through all the dates and adding only the ones which do not have ‘hide’ class added to them. The selected dates are first expanded such that their complete view is available while generating the image. The complete data is stored in a variable depending on if the complete schedule is requested for download or some filter is applied, which is later used for generating the image.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">let</span> fullScheduler = <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">true</span>;\r\n<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">let</span> mapValue = <span style=\"color: #a31515\">''</span>;\r\n\r\npdf = <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">new</span> jsPDF(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'l'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'pt'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'a1'</span>);\r\n$(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'.calendar'</span>).each(<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">function</span>() {\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">let</span> hidePresent = $(<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>).attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'class'</span>).split(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">' '</span>).indexOf(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'hide'</span>) &lt;= 0;\r\n\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">if</span> (hidePresent) {\r\n   $timeline = $(<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>);\r\n\r\n  <span style=\"color: #008000\">// Expanding the schedule for current date</span>\r\n  ...\r\n  ...\r\n }\r\n fullScheduler = hidePresent &amp;&amp; fullScheduler;\r\n});\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">if</span>(fullScheduler) {\r\n $timeline = $(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'.calendar'</span>).parent();\r\n mapValue = $timeline.children();\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<h2><b>Adding the notification while generating the PDF</b></h2>\n<p>A loader with the notification is added to provide better user experience, as the PDF generation takes place at the time of request itself it may take some time depending on the size of the schedule.

The organizer is required to generate an API key and client ID on Google developers console and add the generated credentials to web app generator. The credentials are added to the generated application and every session is added with an Add to calendar button, which on click makes the request to add the corresponding session to the calendar.</p>\n<h2><b>Creating Client ID and API key</b></h2>\n<p>Enable the Google calendar API from Google developers console. Go to `Create Credentials` tab and generate an API key and client ID for your app. While creating the client ID, an input field is present which requires Authorised javascript origins, mention the domains where the generated application would be deployed.</p>\n<h2><b>Adding Client ID and API key to the generator</b></h2>\n<p>The Client ID and API key obtained from the developer console is added to the web app generator.

Whenever the delete operation is performed, the selected images are moved to the Trash Bin and the user has the option to either delete the photos permanently or restoring back the deleted photos by navigating to the Trash bin section. So in this post, I’d be discussing the implementation of permanently deleting image/images from the Trashbin.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Firstly, we need to add permanent delete option in the popup menu provided in the itemview in the TrashView section. Every item in the Trashbin section displays a popup menu with two options-restore and delete permanently. The permanent delete option has been implemented in the itemview by adding the following lines of code.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;?xml version=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;1.0&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> encoding=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;utf-8&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">?&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;menu xmlns:android=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> xmlns:app=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> &lt;item</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     android:id=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@+id/delete_permanently&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     android:title=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@string/delete_permanently&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     app:showAsAction=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;never&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> /&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;/menu&gt;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>\n<b>Step 2</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now when the user opts to permanently delete any photo from the bin, a function </span><b>deletePermanent</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> would be invoked passing-in the trashbin object corresponding to the selected item as the parameter. Inside the deletePermanent method, a check is performed to determine whether the corresponding image file exists or not using the </span><b>.exists</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> method of the </span><b>File </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">class and if the result is true the file is deleted permanently using the .delete method of the </span><b>File </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">class. The method deletePermanent returns a boolean value depending on whether the image file is deleted permanently from the storage or not. The code snippets used to implement the deletePermanent method is provided below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">private</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">boolean</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">deletePermanent</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(TrashBinRealmModel trashBinRealmModel){</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">boolean</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> succ = </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">false</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   String path = trashBinRealmModel.getTrashbinpath();</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   File file = </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">new</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;/&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> + </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;.nomedia&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">//File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + &#8220;/&#8221; + &#8220;TrashBin&#8221;);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">if</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(file.exists()){</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       File file1 = </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">new</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> File(path);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">if</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(file1.exists()){</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">           succ = file1.delete();</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       }</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   }</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">return</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> succ;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">}</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>\n<b>Step 3</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The function deletePermanent used implemented in the previous step returns a boolean value which will be used in this step. So if the deletePermanent method returns true indicating that the image has been deleted from the trashbin, first a method </span><b>deleteFromRealm </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is invoked passing-in the path of the image in the Trashbin to delete the corresponding image’s record from the realm database. Thereafter, that particular trashbin item is removed from the ArrayList&lt;TrashbinRealmModel&gt; populating the TrashBin adapter to display the items in the TrashBin Activity and the adapter is notified of this change by the use of </span><b>NotifyItemRemoved</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><b>NotifyItemRangeChanged</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> methods of the RecyclerView adapter class passing-in the position of the item as parameter to the former and position along with the size of the updated list as parameters to the latter function. After the adapter is updated about the change in the dataset, the adapter re-populates the recyclerview thus displaying the remaining items in the trashbin section. The code snippets implementing the above-mentioned operations are provided below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">if</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(deletePermanent(trashBinRealmModel)){</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   deleteFromRealm(trashItemsList.get(position).getTrashbinpath());</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   trashItemsList.remove(position);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   notifyItemRemoved(position);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   notifyItemRangeChanged(position, trashItemsList.size());</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">}</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span>private </span><span>void</span> <span>deleteFromRealm</span><span>(</span><span>final</span><span> String path){</span><span><br />\n</span><span>   Realm realm = Realm.getDefaultInstance();</span><span><br />\n</span><span>   realm.executeTransaction(</span><span>new</span><span> Realm.Transaction() {</span><span><br />\n</span><span>       </span><span>@Override</span> <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>execute</span><span>(Realm realm) {</span><span><br />\n</span><span>           RealmResults&lt;TrashBinRealmModel&gt; trashBinRealmModels = realm.where(TrashBinRealmModel.class).equalTo</span><span><br />\n</span><span>                   (</span><span>&#8220;trashbinpath&#8221;</span><span>, path).findAll();</span><span><br />\n</span><span>           trashBinRealmModels.deleteAllFromRealm();</span><span><br />\n</span><span>       }</span><span><br />\n</span><span>   });</span><span><br />\n</span><span>}</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is how we have implemented the functionality to permanently delete an image from the Trashbin section in the Phimpme Android application.

However, another important functionality that has been implemented is the option to compress an image. Two modes of compress operation have been implemented namely compress by size and compress by dimensions. In the previous blog post I discussed the implementation of compress by size operation. So in this blog post, I will be discussing how we achieved the functionality to compress any image by resolution.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, we need to add an option in the bottombar menu(in the SingleMediaActivity) to </span><b>compress </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the image being viewed. The option to compress an image has been added by implementing the following lines of code in the  menu_bottom_view_pager.xml file.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;item</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:id=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@+id/action_compress&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:orderInCategory=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;2&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       app:showAsAction=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;always&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:icon=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@drawable/compressicn&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:title=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;Compress&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">/&gt;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><b>Step 2</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now on selecting the compress option, the user would be prompted to choose the compress mode i.e compress by size or compress by dimension.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once the user opts for compressing the image by resolution, a dialog containing the various resolutions options to choose from is to be displayed. Code snippets used to implement the dialog along with seekbar is displayed below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:

</span><a href=\"https://github.com/zetbaitsu/Compressor\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Compressor</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to obtain the compress by resolution functionality. After the user has specified the new resolution required, the </span><b>Compressor</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> class of the library is instantiated by passing-in the context as the parameter and some of its functions are invoked simaltaneously. The functions invoked are setMaxWidth(), setMaxHeight(),  setCompressFormat(), setDestinationDirectoryPath(), compressToFile(). </span></p>\n<p><b>setMaxWidth() </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8211; to set the width of the output image.</span></p>\n<p><b>setMaxHeight() </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8211; to set the height of the output image.</span></p>\n<p><b>setCompressFormat(Bitmap.CompressFormat) </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8211; to determine the format of the output compressed image.</span></p>\n<p><b>setDestinationDirectoryPath(File) </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8211; to specify the path to which the compressed image is to be saved.</span></p>\n<p><b>compressToFile(File) </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8211; to perform the compress operation, passing-in the file object of the corresponding image to be compressed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The compressToFile() function performs the final compress operation and saves the compressed image to the specified path.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Code snippets to implement the above mentioned operations are given below</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">private</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">void</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">compressDim</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">() {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   ListCompressAdapter lviewAdapter;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   ArrayList&lt;String&gt;

However, another important functionality that has been implemented is the option to compress an image. Two modes of compress operation have been implemented namely compress by size and compress by dimensions. So in this blog post, I will be discussing how we achieved the functionality to compress any image by size.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, we need to add an option in the bottom bar menu(in the SingleMediaActivity) to </span><b>compress </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the image being viewed. The option to compress an image has been added by implementing the following lines of code in the  menu_bottom_view_pager.xml file.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;item</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:id=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@+id/action_compress&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:orderInCategory=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;2&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       app:showAsAction=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;always&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:icon=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@drawable/compressicn&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:title=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;Compress&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">/&gt;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><b>Step 2</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now on selecting the compress option, the user would be prompted to choose the compress mode i.e compress by size or compress by dimension. Once the user has opted for the size mode a dialog with a seekbar to set the compress percentage is to be displayed. Code snippets used to implement the dialog along with seekbar is displayed below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;RelativeLayout</span><span

So in this blog post, I will be discussing the undo operation option implemented for the delete image feature in Phimpme Android app. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Firstly, we need to add an “Undo” action button in the Snackbar that displays the success operation message. With this addition, the user would have time to undo an operation until the snackbar message is being displayed on the screen. The undo action button can be added to the Snackbar by the use of the </span><b>setAction</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> method of the Snackbar class. The code snippets used to implement the button is provided below</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Snackbar snackbar = SnackBarHandler.showWithBottomMargin2(mDrawerLayout, String.valueOf(no) + </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8221; &#8220;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> + getString(R.string</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">               .trashbin_move_onefile),</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       navigationView.getHeight</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">               (), Snackbar.LENGTH_SHORT);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">snackbar.setAction(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;UNDO&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">new</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> View.OnClickListener() {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">@Override</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">public</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">void</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">onClick</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(View view) {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       getAlbum().moveAllMedia(getApplicationContext(), getAlbum().getPath(), media1);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       refreshListener.onRefresh();</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   }</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">});</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">snackbar.show();</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>\n<b>Step 2</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the user performs the delete operation, first the photos are moved to the trashbin and the user have the option to delete them from there. Now, if the user opts for undo operation, on clicking the undo button the function moveallMedia will be invoked passing-in context, the path of the current album and an ArrayList&lt;Media&gt; containing the deleted media on which the undo operation is to be performed upon, as parameters. Here the ArrayList&lt;Media&gt; passed as a parameter contains the trashbin paths of the images deleted by the previous action. A method storeDeletedFilesTemporarily has been used that returns the list containing the deleted images trashbin paths. The implementation of the method storeDeletedFilesTemporarily has been provided below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>private ArrayList&lt;Media&gt; storeDeletedFilesTemporarily(){<br />\nArrayList&lt;Media&gt; deletedImages = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();<br />\nif(!all_photos &amp;&amp; !fav_photos &amp;&amp; editMode){<br />\nfor(Media m: getAlbum().getSelectedMedia()){<br />\nString name = m.getPath().substring(m.getPath().lastIndexOf(&#8220;/&#8221;) + 1);<br />\ndeletedImages.add(new Media(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + &#8220;/&#8221; + &#8220;.nomedia&#8221; + &#8220;/&#8221; + name));<br />\n}<br />\n} else if(all_photos &amp;&amp; !fav_photos &amp;&amp; editMode){<br />\nfor(Media m: selectedMedias){<br />\nString name = m.getPath().substring(m.getPath().lastIndexOf(&#8220;/&#8221;) + 1);<br />\ndeletedImages.add(new Media(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + &#8220;/&#8221; + &#8220;.nomedia&#8221; + &#8220;/&#8221; + name));<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\nreturn deletedImages;<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>\n<b>Step 3</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now in the final step, I’d discuss the implementation of the moveAllMedia method that actually completes the undo operation. As I mentioned earlier that on performing the delete operation the images are moved to the bin folder(which is hidden from the other applications), so the moveAllMedia method here will again move the images from the trashbin folder to the current folder. With this operation deleted images would be stored back to their original folder and their trashbin record would be simultaneously deleted from the Realm database. The code implementation of the moveAllMedia method is provided below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">public</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">int</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">moveAllMedia</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Context context, String targetDir, ArrayList&lt;Media&gt;

Whenever the delete operation is performed, the selected images are moved to the Trash Bin and the user has the option to either delete the photos permanently or restoring back the deleted photos by navigating to the Trash bin section. So, in this post I’d be discussing the implementation of restore image/images functionality.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Firstly, we need to add restore option in the popup menu provided in the itemview in the TrashView section. Every item in the Trashbin section displays a popup menu with two options-restore and delete permanently. The popup menu along with the two options have been implemented by adding the following lines of code.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;?xml version=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;1.0&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> encoding=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;utf-8&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">?&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;menu xmlns:android=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> xmlns:app=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> &lt;item</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     android:id=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@+id/restore_option&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     android:title=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@string/restore_photo&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     app:showAsAction=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;never&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> /&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> &lt;item</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     android:id=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@+id/delete_permanently&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     android:title=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@string/delete_permanently&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     app:showAsAction=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;never&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> /&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;/menu&gt;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><b>Step 2</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now after the user opts to restore a particular image, the corresponding realm object for the image would be retrieved from the Realm database. This realm object would contain attributes namely trashbinpath, oldpath, datetime, timeperiod. Here the oldpath attribute contains the path where it  was stored in the device storage before the delete operation was performed on the image. Thereafter to restore the image to its old path, a move operation would be performed which would move the image from the TrashBin section to the album it was stored in before deletion. With this move operation, the image is restored to its old path and is visible in the respective album resulting in the removal/deletion of the image from the TrashBin section. The method implemented to perform the above mentioned operations is provided below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">private</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">boolean</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">restoreImage</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(TrashBinRealmModel trashBinRealmModel){</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   String oldpath = trashBinRealmModel.getOldpath();</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">boolean</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> success = </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">false</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">try</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       String from = trashBinRealmModel.getTrashbinpath();</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">if</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (success = moveMedia(context, from, targetDir)) {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">           scanFile(context, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">new</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> String[]{ from, StringUtils.getPhotoPathMoved(pathofmed, targetDir) });</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       }</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   } </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">catch</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">return</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> success;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">}</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><b>Step 3</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the previous step, the move operation for the restore feature was performed by the restoreImage method which inturn uses method moveMedia() to get the job done. So in this step, I’d be discussing about the implementation of the moveMedia() method. Inside the moveMedia() method, moveFile method of ContentHelper class is invoked passing-in context, sourcefile, and the destination folder as the parameters. Thereafter a normal rename operation is performed by the use of the renameTo method to move the file to destination folder. Now if the rename operation is performed successfully, the file is moved to its old path whereas if the rename operation fails to get the job done, a copy operation is initiated to copy the file to the destination folder and the image  the is deleted from the trashbin section if the copy operation is successful. The code snippets used to implement the moveMedia and moveFile are provided below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">private</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">boolean</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">moveMedia</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Context context, String source, String targetDir) {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">  File from = </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">new</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> File(source);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">  File to = </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">new</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> File(targetDir);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">return</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> ContentHelper.moveFile(context, from, to);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">}</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>moveFile</span><span>(Context context, @NonNull </span><span>final</span><span> File source, @NonNull </span><span>final</span><span> File targetDir) {</span><span><br />\n</span><span>  </span><span>// First try the normal rename.</span><span><br />\n</span><span>  File target = </span><span>new</span><span> File(targetDir, source.getName());</span><span><br />\n</span><span><br />\n</span><span>  </span><span>boolean</span><span> success = source.renameTo(target);</span><span><br />\n</span><span><br />\n</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> (!success) {</span><span><br />\n</span><span>     success = copyFile(context, source, targetDir);</span><span><br />\n</span><span>     </span><span>if</span><span> (success) {</span><span><br />\n</span><span>        success = deleteFile(context, source);</span><span><br />\n</span><span>     }</span><span><br />\n</span><span>  }</span><span><br />\n</span><span>  </span><span>//if (success) scanFile(context, new String[]{ source.getPath(), target.getPath() });</span><span><br />\n</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> success;</span></p>\n<p><span>}</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is how we have implemented the functionality to restore a deleted image in the Phimpme Android application.

It was the first language I referred to anyone because it was quite easy to start with and delivers amazing results to the developers in no time. Although it was quite a break from having to program in C and Java, the language felt lacking in some of the most important areas.</p><h3>The deal breaker</h3><p>Now came Node.js into my life and I began experimenting with concurrency patterns. Backend JavaScript? Who would take that seriously? At best, it seemed like a new attempt to make server-side development easier at the cost of performance, scalability, etc. Maybe it’s just my ingrained developer skepticism, but there’s always been that alarm that goes off in my brain when I read about something being fast and easy and production-level.</p><p>Node.js became my go to language for a very long time. I got used to the latest programming syntaxes with using ES7 in the client side of things. The single threaded node event-loop made miracles possible for me, without severing any kind of performance and being cheap to use. As time passed, I began a deeper dive into the world of npm modules and the architecture of Node.js. It is a magical space filled with unicorns and rainbows.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*In5xU4obN2qlDEMAyPwg_w.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Performance at it’s best?</figcaption></figure><p>Most developers have heard about Node’s non-blocking I/O model; it’s great because it means all requests are handled asynchronously without blocking execution, or incurring any overhead (like with threads and processes) and as the developer you can be blissfully unaware what’s happening in the backend. However, it’s always important to keep in mind that Node is single-threaded which means none of your code runs in parallel. I/O may not block the server but your code certainly does. If you call sleep for 5 seconds, your server will be unresponsive during that time. But my actual problem came with JavaScript. I know most of you will feel this like a rant and there are ways to solve this problem. Please, just bear with me through this.</p><p>When people were developing JavaScript, they wanted it to do all sorts of things and serve every other purpose. It all started with those thoughts, which made it kind of messy. Determining boolean outcomes in plain old JavaScript is hard.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TdKBZcFORJk1sMuKmELNTw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>True? False? Confused all in all.</figcaption></figure><pre>// all true</pre><pre>1 == '1';<br />1 == [1];<br />'1' == [1];</pre><pre>// all false</pre><pre>1 === '1';<br />1 === [1];<br />'1' === [1];</pre><p>The internal type system of JavaScript is a mixed bag with six different types which causes all sorts of havoc to the end user.</p><ul><li>Undefined (a variable with no defined value)</li><li>Null (a single null value)</li><li>Boolean (true or false)</li><li>Number (this includes Infinity and NaN – not a number!)</li><li>String (textual data)</li><li>Symbol (a unique and immutable primitive new to ES6/2015)</li></ul><p>I know there are ways to sort out these issues effectively, but a language experiencing these sorts of mutability can be problematic to users who are new to JavaScript world.</p><p>Then comes callback hell and having to deal with Promises and all in all the new keywords async and await . I always had retrospection over my language choices and it became very clear that I need strong typing and I can’t live without it. I tried TypeScript but it seemed a bit too expressive to start with.</p><h3>The Second Deal Breaker</h3><p>My main requirements for a language were speed, reliability, built-in concurrency patterns, a strong type system, garbage collection and lots of tooling. It’s not until recent times that I felt the need for all this stuff. I heard rumours earlier about Google building a new language that is going to change the world. True to the naming, it really brought about some deal breaking changes. Here’s a list of things I like about Go and why you’ll love it too.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*L3wZZlN4wBjuF-W1vLfhCw.jpeg\" /><figcaption><strong>go get -u programmer.life/success</strong></figcaption></figure><h4>Opinionated</h4><p>Yes, it is very opinionated. But, I love the way of doing things in one way. With Golang, to do something, there’s just one way of doing it. The official tooling built around Go ensures that we do follow the one way.</p><h4>Goroutines</h4><p>The first half of Go’s concurrency paradigms. Lightweight, concurrent function execution. You can spawn tons of these if needed and the Go runtime multiplexes them onto the configured number of CPUs/Threads as needed. They start with a super small stack that can grow (and shrink) via dynamic allocation (and freeing). They are as simple as go f(x), where f() is a function.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_c9Ob50Cdmh09wLSzHRKgQ.png\" /><figcaption>I am strong. Because my dad wanted me to be.</figcaption></figure><h4>Channels</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/425/1*H2Qh0oiHP64TkG4-Nnjtng.png\" /></figure><p>The other half of Go’s concurrency story. Channels are a typed conduit used to send and receive values. These are used to pass values to and from Goroutines for processing. They are by default unbuffered, meaning synchronous and blocking. They can also be buffered, allowing values to queue up inside of them for processing. Multiple go routines can read/write to them at the same time without having to take locks. Go also has primitives for reading from multiple channels simultaneously via the select statement.</p><h4>Compiled Static Binaries</h4><p>Go compiles your program into a <strong>static binary</strong>. Yep, you heard it right. A <strong>static binary</strong>. This makes deployment really simple. Just copy the binary and it should be good to go. No pip install, no virtualenv, no freaking npm install . All of that is handled at compile time.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*BES005dHRZzV4WBtA7XV7Q.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Binaries defeat all!</figcaption></figure><h4>Cross Compilation</h4><p>This is too good to be true. But it is. Yes. Golang allows cross compilation. Ever wanted to test your program on Windows but you use Linux? No more installing compilation tools and building it again on windows. Simply, use GOOS=windows and you can compile it on a Mac or a Linux machine. It even allows changing the architecture of the platform with GOARCH . There’s a laundry list of available platforms and OSes. You can find the list <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/asukakenji/f15ba7e588ac42795f421b48b8aede63\">here</a>.</p><h4>Runtime</h4><p>Go is a complied language, but still has a runtime. It handles all of the details of mallocing memory for you, allocating/deallocating space for variables, etc. Memory used by variables lasts as long as the variables are referenced, which is usually the scope of a function. Go has a garbage collector.</p><h4>Pass by Value</h4><p>“For the love of all holy Mary, please don’t bring back pointers.” And, well, yeah, they almost averted the crisis in the case of Golang. Everything is passed by value, but there are pointers. It’s just that the value of a pointer is a memory location, so it acts as pass by reference. This means that, by default, there is no shared state between functions. But, you can pass a pointer if you desire/need it for performance/memory utilization reasons. Go does the right thing by default, but doesn’t shackle you. Oh, and there isn’t any pointer math, so you won’t screw yourself with it. As pointed out on <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5196498\">HN</a>, you can do pointer math with the <a href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/\">“unsafe”</a> package and unsafe.Pointer.</p><h4>Type System</h4><p>Go has structs and interfaces. Go’s structs can have methods <em>associated</em> with them. Structs can be anonymously included in other structs to make the inside struct’s variables/methods available as part of the enclosting struct. Interfaces are sets of method signatures. Structs implement an interface by implementing the methods described by the interface definition. Functions can receive values by interface, like <a href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/KfKLiAClQE\">so</a>. The compiler checks all of this at compile time.</p><h4>Package System</h4><p>Or lack there of. Since Go compiles everything statically, you don’t have to worry about packages at runtime. But how do you include libraries into your code? Simply by importing them via url, like so: import \"github.com/bmizerany/pq\". Go’s tooling knows how to look that up and clone the repo. Also works with Mercurial, Bazaar &amp; Subversion. go get it, my boy.</p><h4>Anon. Functions &amp; Closures</h4><p>Go supports anonymous functions that can form closures. These functions can then be passed around and retain the environment under which they were created, like <a href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/4rYrqw4l7m\">so</a>. This can be super powerful when <a href=\"https://github.com/freeformz/filechan\">combined</a> with channels and go routines.</p><h4>Built in profiling</h4><p>It supports pprof as a part of the standard library. And with a <a href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/\">very small bit of work</a>, you can access profiling info via a http interface.</p><h4>Defer</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/340/1*9IyFa5ur0nALjTmnACHkGQ.png\" /><figcaption>I love to postpone work, yeah.</figcaption></figure><p>Ever forget to close a file descriptor or free some memory? So have the designers of Go. The reason for this is that you usually have to perform those actions far away from where the resources were opened/allocated. Go solves this problem with the defer statement. Each defer statement pushes a function/expression onto a stack that get’s executed in LIFO order after the enclosing function returns. This makes cleanup really easy, after opened a file, just defer file.Close().</p><h4>Comprehensive Standard Library</h4><p>Go’s <a href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/\">standard library</a> is pretty comprehensive.</p><h4>It’s Fast</h4><p>Go compiles down to native code and it does it fast. Usually in just a few seconds. No matter if you have a million package imports. It does compile in seconds. There’s a rumour that Golang actually came to life over a discussion developers had during a <em>code compilation</em> break.</p><h4>Comprehensive Tooling Out Of The Box</h4><p>Go do a go --help. Some of my favorites: go fmt, go doc, go fix go get go tool pprof&amp; go test.</p><h4>Straight Forward Testing</h4><p>Super <a href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/testing/\">straight foward</a>, no magic. And hell, yeah, it even has a <a href=\"https://blog.golang.org/race-detector\">race detector</a> that finds out all your runtime woes even before hitting production.</p><h4>Simple C Interface</h4><p>By using build directives you can integrate with C libraries really <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/freeformz/4552031\">easily</a>.</p><h4>Straight Forward Syntax / Standard Formatting</h4><p>The syntax is pretty simple, C like w/o all the crazy of C. But what’s really nice is go fmt, which re-writes your code into the Go standard format. No more arguments like tabs vs spaces or indentation rules! There’s just one way and you have to stick to it my friend.</p><h3>Golang’s Cons</h3><p>With all of that said, it’s not perfect…</p><h4>Runtime</h4><p>Go’s runtime is not super <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_does_Go_perform_badly_on_benchmark_x\">tuned</a> yet. By comparison the JVM has had over 18 years of development history behind it. But, for a 1.0.X runtime &amp; language, Go is pretty damn good.</p><h4>Garbage Collector</h4><p>Go programs can malloc a lot of ram at times, even when the program itself isn’t using much. Most of this shows up as VIRT though, so most linux systems just won’t care.</p><h4>1 CPU by default</h4><p>This is going to change over time, but the runtime will, by default, use only <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_no_multi_CPU\">one CPU</a>.</p><p>I can bear with having a few cons. After all nothing is perfect in this world. I can live by knowing that there are a few disadvantages while using a language as long as they don’t affect programming like JavaScript’s falsity or callback hell.</p><img height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=681a70f3bc79\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/my-new-roots/the-gopher-way-681a70f3bc79\">The Gopher way</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/my-new-roots\">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","published":"2018-08-23T06:07:52.000Z","author":"","link":"https://medium.com/my-new-roots/the-gopher-way-681a70f3bc79?source=rss----3f7df00e1da2---4","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"Naveen Kumar Sangi: How Open Source turned my Life Around.","content":"<p>A short story on how things changed.</p><p>2017 was a massive year in my life as a developer. It brought about no small changes both in how I go about writing code as well as how I interact with other developers. The one thing that “<strong>matter</strong><em>ed the</em> <strong>most</strong>” is <strong>collaboration</strong>.<strong> 🙌</strong> It’s not just that open source development demands a greater degree of collaboration, but the acceleration of open source as a movement on all ends during the past few years has actually redefined how software development is done. It became a highly collaborative process with distributed version control systems everywhere. 🌍</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/620/1*v5o3JVZVH_74c8gl-k6Pmw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Open source ❤️</figcaption></figure><p>This totally changed the way I write code 💻 . To begin with, it has helped me <em>organise my development workflow</em>. For example, when I want to work on a bug fix or a new feature, I can <strong>branch</strong> off anytime. While <strong>Git</strong> has had an impact on how I personally write code, what has transformed software development into a truly collaborative process has been the rise of code hosting services such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\">Bitbucket</a> or <a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx\">Visual Studio Team Services</a>, which provide tools for implementing a collaboration <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow\">workflow</a> based on Git, with work isolated into branches, organized into commits and documented with commit messages.</p><p>Google Summer of Code 2017 was the one major thing in my life that totally changed it. 😇 I was initially only hoping to finish up the project to 💰 gain money. Only now do I understand that money is the least of the goodies from GSoC. To start with, it gave me new friends 👬 and connections. That is the huge part of the deal. Being a GSoC alumni, you can dive into any of the GSoC summits taking place everywhere in the world. Although I haven't attended any yet, I’m planning on visiting somewhere next year. I’m so thankful to my mentors for patiently <a href=\"https://medium.com/my-new-roots/we-all-have-bad-days-f59a334f0641\">bearing with me through GSoC</a>. Our interaction during the small period of three months brought about some of the most interesting changes in my life. I was offered a contract as a part time freelancer while still being in college. That moment when you really can pay your bills 🎉 was epic. I worked for almost an year of college and it never felt burdening as some of my friends said it would. 😏</p><p>Then comes Mozilla 🦊 into my life. 20th November 2017, marks the day we applied for Mozilla Open Source Support. We were initially so skeptical about the deal and were not sure how much our project aligns to Mozilla’s 🔐 privacy guidelines. Our product wasn’t much focused on privacy, so we had our doubts. We waited patiently through the first couple of months and then lost our hope gradually. But, miraculously, 😍 they reached out to us after five months with the news that I was awarded with the Mozilla Open Source Support Award 2017. By the time I was aware of the news, our project was halfway done. This really eased things up for me. Although the total period of the project was a whopping 12 months, we finished it up in almost half the time thanks to my enthusiastic mentors.</p><p>I never attended a college placement as I wasn’t keen on doing a full time job and wanted to continue as a freelancer. I also have plans for higher studies, so I didn’t want to pull myself into job woes 😩. Initially, I regretted my decision for not attending on-campus placements soon after I left college. Almost all of my friends were busy starting their new lives at companies. It felt so lonely and disturbing. That was the moment I decided to go full out on the search for a job. With about two years of open source record on my resume, it wasn’t that difficult to gain a job in the world outside of placements. I was contacted by atleast 20 companies in the span of a month and I started making choices. I attended 3 interviews and got selected 💃 in two of them. By the end of the month, I had two opportunities to choose from. Then, came my saviour, ❤️Lasse, one of my mentors from GSoC. He brought to me another opportunity to work with a community of people I’ve already known from GSoC. Imagine how refreshing 😍 it would feel to continue working with people whom you already love to work with. I dished out all other options and went with my mentor. I never had the thought that landing a job would be this effortless, provided you have good connections. And a GSoC really helped me get those good connections. I kind of hoped that “making choices” part would come to my life at some point. But, I never knew that it would be so early in life. (I am still 20 😁)</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/666/1*77t4yNKlgeHMN1selgRqlA.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Welcome to the Dark Side.</figcaption></figure><blockquote>I hope your journey into open source would be as enriching for you as it has been for me.</blockquote><img height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f5a1e4f6417d\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/my-new-roots/how-open-source-turned-my-life-around-f5a1e4f6417d\">How Open Source turned my Life Around.</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/my-new-roots\">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","published":"2018-08-13T05:55:59.000Z","author":"","link":"https://medium.com/my-new-roots/how-open-source-turned-my-life-around-f5a1e4f6417d?source=rss----3f7df00e1da2---4","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"Abinash Senapati: Flip bits, not burgers","content":"<p><a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/\"><img alt=\"Flip bits not burgers\" src=\"http://vip-k.ir/Administrator/Files/slider/slide22128.png\" /></a></p>","published":"2018-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","author":"","link":"https://techievena.github.io/gsoc/2018/08/07/gsoc-submission.html","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"Liquid Galaxy Voice Control powered by Google Assistant","content":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CnI-ImaNLWI/W14DwtCuxUI/AAAAAAAGfBk/WQpVBGf2LMUsiCA0Esg9wEKqevRSUzuOgCLcBGAs/s1600/Definitivo%2BVoice%2BControl.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1103\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CnI-ImaNLWI/W14DwtCuxUI/AAAAAAAGfBk/WQpVBGf2LMUsiCA0Esg9wEKqevRSUzuOgCLcBGAs/s640/Definitivo%2BVoice%2BControl.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Diseño por Sofia Lu Xia</span></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><br /></span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><br /></span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Diversos estudiantes de todo el mundo están trabajando en implementar la navegación y acceso a funcionalidades diversas de la app Android Liquid Galaxy Controller.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><br /></span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Entre otros, Tarun, Omshi, estudiantes brasileiros de la universidad de Facens, Brasil, y con el diseño del logo por Sofia Lu Xia, y la coordinación de Deniz Yüksel.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><a href=\"https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/LGxVoiceControl\" target=\"_blank\">- Propuesta de código por Tarun Ravin</a></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">- <a href=\"https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/LGxVoiceControl-1\" target=\"_blank\">Propuesta de código por Omshi Samal</a></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br /></span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><br /></span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><br /></span></div>","published":"2018-07-29T18:17:00.001Z","author":"Andreu Ibáñez","link":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4643387265233889970/posts/default/7376292580411986295","feed":{"source":"http://www.liquidgalaxylab.com/feeds/posts/default","name":"Liquid Galaxy LAB","link":"http://www.liquidgalaxylab.com/feeds/posts/default"}},{"title":"Naveen Kumar Sangi: I’m bored of life.","content":"<h4>That was me until the past week.</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*P-VQUqX0isRifLoC4M-vEw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Embrace your life. Image credits: Unsplash.com</figcaption></figure><p>It can be frustrating to to hear about how to make your life wonderful by doing things that you can’t necessarily do on a daily basis because of your job or lifestyle. I hear about people travelling all time to far flung places, or spending days outside, and the only thing that I can think of is how unfair it is that I’m cooped up in my home, with the only view of outside being the screen in front of me.</p><p>However, as someone like me who likes to make the most of each day, (not just weekends!), there are a few things I do to make even my most mundane Mondays a little brighter, because I’m a big believer that every day should be made ridiculously amazing!</p><h4>Get up an hour earlier.</h4><p>Yes. I know my friends. We all are insomniacs and stay up all night doing all kinds of things. But, do give it a try, an early sleep and early rise can truly fresh up your day a lot. Use the time to take a stroll down to a park or even just the sidewalk, if you don’t live near any park. Frantically running into showers, driving or walking to the office, and sitting at your desk before your body has even had time to adjust to your new day, only worsens your day. Set yourself a tone for the mellower day, instead.</p><h4>Make a to-do list in the morning.</h4><p>Thanks to few of my colleagues, I recently started writing up to-do lists at work. It feels so refreshing at the end of the day seeing all those check marks. To give it a try, I brought the same change to my life, not just work. It just feels too good to be true, that simple things like these really refresh your day. But this trick really does work.</p><h4>Make movement non-negotiable.</h4><p>Halfway through your morning and through the afternoon, I force myself to standup and walk around. (Couldn’t do that earlier, so, I forced my laptop to go to sleep, if I didn’t have a walk in time.) I’m trying to do this as often as possible. This helped me have a break from all the problems at work. Work is just work to get paid. It shouldn’t be haunting your afterlife.</p><h4>At lunch, get away from your computer.</h4><p>Be in the moment. Enjoy whatever the food you are eating. Get outside and have a walk, read a book or just take in the day for whatever amount of time you can spare.</p><h4>Do something different each evening.</h4><p>This helps in keeping you away from boredom. Routine way of life gets you bored easily. Don’t just come home, eat dinner and relax on the couch. We should mix things up, if anything go for a long drive out into the wilderness, have a hike planned, take your pet for a walk or visit a beach, watch some movies (the kind you have never seen before) or just have bonfires in the backyard. Just because it is “an evening in the weekdays” doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy it!</p><h4>Don’t go into an eating rut!</h4><p>Have something you really enjoy for each meal. Even if it it’s something cooked at home, have a change of menu everyday. And I tried cooking something on my own, didn’t turn out to be good, but it really gave me a lot of satisfaction. Plan out some fun dinner, which is both fun to make and eat! Once you start experimenting in the kitchen, it is hard to stop and the possibilities are endless!</p><h4>Reminiscing your day before bed.</h4><p>Be thankful for everything that happened during the day. The most important thing of all these things is to practice mindfulness throughout the day. Even on your way to work, which may seem like the most mundane thing ever, take in the weather, the sounds, the sights. At work, notice the people around you, and make the best of whatever your job might be. You’re there, so may as well make the best of it and take pride in your accomplishments. Our world is always changing, every second of every hour, so make sure you witness as much of it as you can.</p><p>Hope this helps at least someone in their life. If these tricks really helped you too, take time to throw in some claps.

I am currently a sophomore in Bilkent University, Ankara. And I am a member of IEEE Bilkent Student Branch where I’ve met Andreu in Mobile Days, March 2016. I have spent a month in Lleida, Liquid Galaxy Labs.<br /><br />To be honest, this was my first internship and I feel very lucky that I could come here from Turkey and learn a lot of things, meet a lot of people. As a foreign student, having a practice outside my country has been an incredible experience both because I discovered significant concepts on computer science and practiced my three-week Spanish that I started learning last summer in Malaga. Here in the labs, there are also workshops and events and people with different ideas come and share their projects, opinions, tools and technologies they use. For instance Lot Amoros, the creator of Dronecoria Project for reforestation, shared his ideas and we, students also shared our opinions about what can be done. This has been a very valuable experience due to the project and meeting Lot Amoros himself. We also had a workshop concerning Google Assistant and AIY Voice Kit with the participation of teenagers. We prepared quizzes and flashcards with Actions on Google to use on Google Home and Google Home Mini.<br /><br /> In this four-week period, I experienced open source with Liquid Galaxy. My colleague Oscar Carrasco, also a visiting student from University La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain, was able to adapt the Liquid Galaxy to chromebooks for the project, Liquid Galaxy for Education. Now, a team of four including me is working on the Android tablet application that will be used for Liquid Galaxy for Education.<br /><br /><br /> As a foreign computer science student, my stay in Lleida has widened my world by all means, and I thank Andreu Ibáñez for this experience and his hospitality!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bpmp_uejnE/W1BhtWNizcI/AAAAAAAGdk0/UJh5MNONErw0zgk_Ck72sOIvVsR5wkTYwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180626_150228.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bpmp_uejnE/W1BhtWNizcI/AAAAAAAGdk0/UJh5MNONErw0zgk_Ck72sOIvVsR5wkTYwCLcBGAs/s640/IMG_20180626_150228.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>My experience visiting Lleida<br />Oscar Carrasco</b></span><br />My name is Óscar Carrasco and I am a junior student of Computer Engineering at Universidad de La Laguna (Tenerife, Spain). <br /><br />I met Andreu in last July, in his TLP Innova conference about Google Summer of Code which really interested me, so I decided to stay in touch with him. We contacted again in November and, one month later, I collaborated with him as a Liquid Galaxy project mentor in the Google Code-in program.<br /><br />This experience was enjoyable to me, so I travelled to Lleida this summer in order to keep developing Open-source software in a project called “Liquid Galaxy for Education”.<br /><br />The first two things that got my attention in Lleida were the blazing hot weather and the lack of sea. Since I’ve been living near the ocean my entire life, it was suffocating not to see it around me. It was hard for me to get used to the climate.<br /><br />The main activity was working in the labs in the morning. We managed to port most of the core Liquid Galaxy features into the Chromebooks during my stance, as it was intended to happen. My partners were also working on improving the legacy Liquid Galaxy Controller Android application during this time.<br /><br />We were also involved in many other tasks. We went to the cinema, had dinner at Punto Estrella, (popular restaurant in Lleida), participated in a local radio channel called UA1, visited a startup called InTech3D and hosted three Google Developer Group meetups in our spare time.

Implement voice commands to move the Liquid Galaxy to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; places. IE: \"Ok Google, go to Izmir, Turkey\", for the LG to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; move to Izmir in Turkey.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; . Implement voice commands to move the camera.

I couldn’t find an easy way to deploy docker images to EC2 instances. So, I made a workaround of my own using a crazy simple tool we all know of, the <strong>SSH</strong>.</p><p>Through this tutorial, I’m gonna be assuming that you have a working EC2 instance with sudo access to the shell and you already have a docker-compose file ready to set off to production.</p><h4>Setting up EC2 instance</h4><p>SSH into your instance and install docker and docker-compose on it. There are numerous tutorials available online on how to install them. So, I’m not gonna cover that here.</p><p>Once you’ve got them setup, choose a location to place your docker-compose.yml file. Preferably somewhere in /opt/&lt;your_app_name&gt; . So, now, try deploying the compose file directly using docker-compose up -d . Once you’re sure that works, let’s move on to the next step.</p><p>Generate an SSH RSA private/public key pair, that we’re going to use to login from GitLab CI runner and run the deploy script. To generate the key pair, we’ll use ssh-keygen.</p><pre>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f privkey</pre><p>Now, you should have two files, privkey and privkey.pub in your current working directory. Paste the contents of privkey as is (without extra spaces) into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the EC2 instance. Copy the contents of privkey.pub , we’ll be using that later from the gitlab CI.</p><h4>Setting up GitLab CI/CD job</h4><p>I’m gonna show an opinionated GitLab CI configuration file, which we’ll be using to build and deploy the images from master branch of the repository.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p68SyHN3hNK0gkXs7554EA.png\" /><figcaption>GitLab CI Configuration.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, we use the GitLab CI preferences pane, where we’ll setup a few environment variables listed below.</p><ul><li>DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY: The contents of privkey.pub which we generated earlier.</li><li>DEPLOY_SERVER_IP : The IP address of the EC2 instance.</li><li>DEPLOY_HOST : The username of the EC2 instance, eg. ubuntu , if you use a ubuntu base image for setting up EC2 instance.</li></ul><p>Make sure that you’ve turned on the protected flag in the variables section for each of the variables to set them only on protected branches like master.</p><p>From the GitLab CI configuration file, you can see that there is a script .ci/deploy.sh on the repository which we’ll be using to run for deployments. It can be something like this.</p><pre># .ci/deploy.sh</pre><pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash<br />set -x -e -o pipefail</pre><pre>COMPOSE_LOCATION=\"/opt/&lt;your_app_name&gt;/master\"<br />DOCKER_GROUP_NAME=\"docker\"</pre><pre># Early checks<br />which docker<br />which docker-compose<br />id -nG | grep \"$DOCKER_GROUP_NAME\"</pre><pre># Start deployment<br />cd $COMPOSE_LOCATION<br />docker-compose pull<br />docker-compose up -d</pre><p>That’s it, you’re done setting up CD with GitLab.</p><img height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5e215154730f\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/my-new-roots/ship-it-5e215154730f\">Ship it!</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/my-new-roots\">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","published":"2018-07-11T02:24:10.000Z","author":"","link":"https://medium.com/my-new-roots/ship-it-5e215154730f?source=rss----3f7df00e1da2---4","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"Liquid Galaxy para Educación","content":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0vjTgqHZCTY/WrzFIIgm6TI/AAAAAAAGEpo/KZqj8ueejmIhkP9_-9V030kUo-_4WBjyACLcBGAs/s1600/_DSC6511.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"869\" data-original-width=\"1303\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0vjTgqHZCTY/WrzFIIgm6TI/AAAAAAAGEpo/KZqj8ueejmIhkP9_-9V030kUo-_4WBjyACLcBGAs/s400/_DSC6511.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />El Liquid Galaxy para Educación es un proyecto bajo desarrollo en 2018 por diferentes actores, como los estudiantes de la Escuela Politécnica Superior de la Universidad de Lleida que trabajan en el Liquid Galaxy LAB, la comunidad mundial a través de nuestro <a href=\"https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>, el partnership con <a href=\"http://www.xenoncomputer.com/xenoncomputer/portada.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Xenon Computer</a>&nbsp;y sus Chromebooks ACER, y diversos profesionales de la educación.<br /><br /><div><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j_5Qcyn_r80/Wpg92fPxiKI/AAAAAAAF_4g/gIqgbknFxP4PRkrPwLaSumzFcuVZhv7vQCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20180227_161423.jpg\" /></div><br />El objetivo del proyecto en desarrollo es crear un compendio de software y documentación que permitan a profesores y otros profesionales de la educación, replicar de una forma sencilla y didáctica la experiencia del Liquid Galaxy en entornos educativos de todo tipo.<br /><br />Para conseguir este objetivo hemos seleccionado trabajar con la plataforma hardware Chromebook de Google, disponible por muchos fabricantes e instalada ya en muchos centros educativos españoles y de todo el mundo. Los Chromebooks son generalmente portátiles de potencia media y fácil uso con su sistema operativo Chrome OS, bajo coste de adquisición, mantenimiento y gestión, y que están muy orientados al mercado educativo.<br /><br />El software estará compuesto primero por el core Liquid Galaxy instalado en los Chromeboosk bajo Crouton, un software que permite la instalación de Linux muy fácil y rápidamente, y que será ejecutado a la vez que el Chrome OS. Aparte está definiéndose y desarrollándose una aplicación Android para ser ejecutaba en una tableta de 7 a 10\", y que dispondrá de los controles del sistema, así como de una aplicación educativa abierta, que vendrá precargada de material educativo para Geografía e Historia y que permitirá a los profesores expandir los contenidos por ellos mismos.<br /><br /><div style=\"background-color: white;

It was the 12th February, 2018 and the list of accepted mentoring organizations was published. I booted up my laptop in excitement to give the list a glance. When I scrolled through, I was unable to find AboutCode (the organization I was contributing to) in the roll. I was devastated at the unfortunate event and spent the next few hours pondering over my endeavour since the past couple of months.</p> <p>I had always dreamt of becoming a DOUBLE GSOCER and I knew it wasn’t going to be easy. This would mean I would have to reiterate the entire process, i.e. shortlist an organization and start contributing from scratch ! After a heavy setback, I decided to continue with the struggle and not give up on my aspiration. I found <a href=\"https://spdx.org/\">SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange)</a> which is an open standard for communicating software bill of material information (including components, copyrights, and security references). I spent the next few weeks exploring the Python library to parse, validate and create SPDX documents and preparing mockups. Since the project involved lexing and parsing, I had to comprehend the fundamentals of compiler theory. Fast forward to the judgement day; I was busy refreshing the GSoC page, in the middle of the road, with my friend to check the result and here’s what it displayed:</p> <figure> <img src=\"https://yash-nisar.github.io/images/gsoc18_acceptance.png\" /> </figure> <p>Furthermore, I received a mail from Google confirming my selection for the paramount program.</p> <figure> <img src=\"https://yash-nisar.github.io/images/gsoc18_acceptance_mail.png\" /> </figure> <h2 id=\"whats-next-\">What’s next ?</h2> <p>The community bonding period is almost over with just a week remaining. I have almost completed upgrading the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Document</code> class and initiated a few bug fixes. I would like to heartily thank my mentors <a href=\"https://github.com/pombredanne\">@pombredanne</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/krysnuvadga\">@krysnuvadga</a> for keeping faith in me throughout the process and giving me the opportunity to be a part of the SPDX community.

Why the title?</h2> <p>Because I am in that phase of life where I need to take one of the most important decisions of my life and it turns out that my thoughts are a chaos. Let’s compare the things I know v/s the things I don’t:</p> <ul> <li>I know what I can do: <ul> <li>Contribute to open source more often.</li> <li>Write more regularly.</li> <li>Start looking for ideas for my research.</li> <li>Finish all the MOOC’s I’ve lined up.</li> <li>Start implementing the pet project I’ve been thinking for months.</li> <li>Read more books.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I don’t know what I would do: <ul> <li>Do I go for a job after B.tech? <ul> <li>If yes, then do I need to do something differently from what I am currently doing?</li> </ul> </li> <li>or, I should rather go for higher studies - MS, Robotics? <ul> <li>If yes, then does the preparation requires that I need to abandon some of the things I’ve listed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Is the preparation for the above two mutually exclusive?</li> </ul> </li> <li>and moreover, I don’t know what is stopping me? <ul> <li>Is it lethargy? <ul> <li>Do I not want to do these things? Nope, it’s the exact opposite, I don’t want to do anything other than these things. I can dedicate any (or all) amount of my free time doing these things.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Am I too busy? <ul> <li>Nope, the workload from College is pretty less. Apart from hanging out with a few friends, I don’t really do much.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do I not put in enough efforts? <ul> <li>No, I try every bit I can to achieve these things, I wake up as early as 5:30, don’t have a girlfriend, no TV, no movies.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do I not have enough resources? <ul> <li>No, I have more than enough resources at hand - I have a fast Internet connection, a powerful computer and access to powerful servers for anything power savvy. I have god friends to support me and wise teachers/mentors to advice me.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Am I just slow? <ul> <li>Yes, probably.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id=\"is-it-the-first-time-you-are-confused\">Is it the first time you are confused?</h2> <p>Every career related decision I had to take up until now, I never really had to sit and think. They just came naturally, take the example of:</p> <ul> <li>What stream after High School? <ul> <li>Biology - Nope, can’t look at blood.</li> <li>Arts - My sense of art is “horrible”, not very good with social sciences either.</li> <li>Commerce - Although I like it, I wasn’t very fond of finding mistakes in other people’s calculation.</li> <li>Mathematics - Hell yeah, let’s go study it.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What college do you want to go to?</p> <p>I was already a student in the Aligarh Muslim University when I applied for B.Tech program - My rank elsewhere was average, so it was the only option. I like the city, my friends are here - I feel like I did no mistake.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id=\"did-you-always-wanted-to-pursue-higher-studies\">Did you always wanted to pursue higher studies?</h2> <p>Nope, I never even thought of pursuing higher education. With the advent of MOOC’s and the Internet, I thought that I would never need formal training. But, soon enough, I was introduced to the field of autonomous robotics and MOOC’s weren’t able to satisfy my hunger, perhaps because it requires practical/physical exposure. At this time, I just had a faint, out of nowhere idea of an MS, but I wasn’t very serious. When no one around me was getting a job I thought we can get, I started to take this idea into consideration.</p> <p>When the results for the third semester were out, a month ago, before entering my name into the website, I thought to myself about planning my reaction and almost naturally, yet passionlessly, my brain spurred out that I am ready to accept whatever I had expected (~ 8 ± 0.2). There need not any “resolutions” wherein I would try working harder the next time or to attend more classes, because what I believe today “Mr. Busy effect” - I won’t be able to give time to other things I (like to) do (contribute to open source, mentor new folks in AMU-OSS, study robotics, write blog posts, read). I also thought that I ain’t learning in class anyways, so my current way of studying (don’t ever open your book in regular days and cram everything the night before the test) was the “optimum” choice.</p> <p>Ready for results, with absolutely no enthusiasm, I entered my credentials into the website and kept staring at it. I was trying to calculate how precarious life can turn out to be - I had scored a whooping 9.4 / 10 (my highest ever in college) and I was actually feeling happy (maybe it was shock, I’m not sure). The next few moments, I critically examined my result only to find out that I have got a few A’s in the subjects I thought I never would and quite ironically I also scored a B in a subject I thought I never would! ;-) I had “my moment” then and there, but soon everything faded away in the color of life.</p> <p>Not until, I had started preparing myself for this (4th) semester’s mid-term tests, I realized that somewhere inside me, I had started to feel that I want to score high again, I want to study for exams - What if I scored low again? - What about MS?</p> <p>This is where I started feeling confused. Can I afford an MS, would I be selected, am I too late?</p> <h3 id=\"solutions-i-thought-of-when-researching-for-this-post\">Solutions (I thought of when researching for this post)</h3> <p>Although I don’t have answers to all (or any) of my questions, it turns out that writing this blog post gave me some clarity on the situation:</p> <ul> <li>I should read more on the topic, especially Quora.</li> <li>I am not late, it is the ideal time to start preparation.</li> <li>that I need to go out there and get things done, no more infinitely long “thought drills”</li> <li>Also, that if you decide to take one step ahead and you would definitely find a way to a solution.</li> </ul> <p>Thank You for reading! - I’d highly appreciate your advice!</p>","published":"2018-03-30T19:03:03.000Z","author":"","link":"http://rj722.tech/statement-of-chaos/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"The Liquid Galaxy experience at Google Code-in 2017 published on Google Open Source main blog and networks","content":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD-fQ1Bs7ck/Wrkm5BQD1kI/AAAAAAAGEU4/xpVGHwxy8rgcFqwOfL_UjWJoifIzTeNSgCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"240\" data-original-width=\"320\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD-fQ1Bs7ck/Wrkm5BQD1kI/AAAAAAAGEU4/xpVGHwxy8rgcFqwOfL_UjWJoifIzTeNSgCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png\" /></a></div><br /><br /><div style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;\">Blog post:&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/03/a-galactic-experience-in-google-code-in.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522169907395000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHsomn7BHDj_T8_2nZjPL3RI5dSgA\" href=\"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/03/a-galactic-experience-in-google-code-in.html\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\" target=\"_blank\">https://opensource.<wbr></wbr>googleblog.com/2018/03/a-<wbr></wbr>galactic-experience-in-google-<wbr></wbr>code-in.html</a></div><div style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;\">Twitter:&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://twitter.com/GoogleOSS/status/978305986954854400&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522169907395000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEG2vX1SXImLTp26_BYfzJnNG9z7Q\" href=\"https://twitter.com/GoogleOSS/status/978305986954854400\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/<wbr></wbr>GoogleOSS/status/<wbr></wbr>978305986954854400</a></div><div style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;\">Facebook:&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.facebook.com/GoogleOpenSource/posts/323518418052988&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522169907395000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGu7Pn76eE-e4Jrw4Zmht6efghWgQ\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GoogleOpenSource/posts/323518418052988\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.<wbr></wbr>facebook.com/GoogleOpenSource/<wbr></wbr>posts/323518418052988</a></div><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;\">Google+:&nbsp;</span><a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://plus.google.com/%2BGoogleOpenSource/posts/TizZ2FkQCuC&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522169907395000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2qR_namBorsSg1yvO8QVrsBEzlA\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/+GoogleOpenSource/posts/TizZ2FkQCuC\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #1155cc; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;\" target=\"_blank\">https://plus.google.com/+<wbr></wbr>GoogleOpenSource/posts/<wbr></wbr>TizZ2FkQCuC</a>","published":"2018-03-26T17:00:00.001Z","author":"Andreu Ibáñez","link":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4643387265233889970/posts/default/69616070866614837","feed":{"source":"http://www.liquidgalaxylab.com/feeds/posts/default","name":"Liquid Galaxy LAB","link":"http://www.liquidgalaxylab.com/feeds/posts/default"}},{"title":"Rahul Jha: Organising the Mozilla visit","content":"<p>During PyCon India, I had the privilege to meet Sanyam (<a href=\"https://github.com/CuriousLeaner\">@CuriousLeaner</a>), whom I already knew as a mentor to many in the #dgplug community, when he visited the coala community space. We had a short discussion about How to nurture Open Source Communities in college? It was then, when @crancg got him to join the slack for AMU-OSS. And then, one wild day we invited Sanyam to come speak at our college and share his insights on OSS and the following event was born.</p> <p><img alt=\"Group_Photo\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15556382/36986480-eacc15be-20bf-11e8-98d0-9ed9c9331f4b.jpg\" /></p> <h2 id=\"what-happened-there\">What happened there?</h2> <h3 id=\"free-and-open-source-software\">Free and Open Source Software</h3> <p>The first part of the session consisted of an introduction to the concept of Free and Open Source Software, and was chaired by Sanyam - the students were made aware of the importance of FOSS in the world. He and the other mentors also took questions and cleared the doubts of students regarding the world of open source.</p> <h3 id=\"how-to-build-an-add-on-for-mozilla\">How to build an Add-on for Mozilla?</h3> <p>The second part of the session was a hands-on technical event, and the students were taught how to implement an add-on (extension) for Mozilla Firefox. The importance of extensions for adding functionality to any browser was stressed, and the students were encouraged to build their own add-ons and to get them published.</p> <h3 id=\"what-next\">What next?</h3> <p>The final part of the event involved the mentors explaining how students could contribute to open source, and how the community was always looking to better itself through the contributions of new and young talent. The talk was inspirational and the students in attendance seemed motivated and encouraged to become a part of the development community.</p> <h2 id=\"vote-of-thanks\">Vote of Thanks</h2> <p>First of all, I would like to thank Sanyam, Shashank and Shivam for coming to the event and inspiring students.

I picked a task from <a href=\"https://coala.io\">coala</a> because, well, I thought “coala” was a cute name. coala is a handy tool that can lint and often fix problems in your source code. They have a very helpful guide for newcomers too, making it easy for anyone to get started with contributing.</p><p>My first task was a coding task, but the process of using git and creating tests proved far tougher than writing the main piece of code. I made a lot of mistakes in these areas, and didn’t do things quite the way I should have been doing them, but with some help from my mentors my work was eventually merged, and I had made my first contribution. Success!</p><p>Almost a month later, and I’ve completed an array of different tasks and learnt a ton of new stuff. School, exams and other priorities meant I couldn’t dedicate as much time as I would have liked to Code-In, but I made sure to attempt a variety of different tasks in different areas. Naturally, I encountered difficulties on almost every task — there was a lot of time spent meticulously reading through source code in an attempt to understand things, and I lost count of the number of times I had to ask for extensions. These difficulties are of course key to improving and amongst other things, I’ve finally got the hang of git, I’ve dabbled with graphics and regex for the first time, and (after several run-ins with coala’s linting bears) I’ve learnt to write cleaner and better code.</p><p>But I think the most important things I have learnt come from the experience of working within a real-life organisation. The process I had to go through in order to understand and build upon existing code taught me a lot, and using various tools to complete my tasks has given me valuable practical skills and knowledge that will no doubt be helpful in the future.</p><p>I’m incredibly grateful to the mentors at coala for providing very detailed and justified feedback where necessary, answering questions and helping me to resolve any problems. Working with such knowledgeable and friendly people has been extremely rewarding, and I hope to continue contributing to the organisation.</p><p>Finally, I’d like to thank Google for making this wonderful experience possible. I’m a little sad that I didn’t find out about GCI sooner as I’ll be too old to participate again next year, but nonetheless, I have had a lot of fun and look forward to diving deeper into the world of OSS!</p><img height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ba254d19ce28\" width=\"1\" />","published":"2018-01-16T21:15:27.000Z","author":"","link":"https://medium.com/@biscuitsnake/code-in-with-coala-ba254d19ce28?source=rss-12bb3099dbe9------2","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"Naveen Kumar Sangi: Boilerplates are fun, right?!","content":"<p>Good bye crappy config files!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/945/1*up5_dOjlNdHMTa3Cw-Ku2w.png\" /></figure><p>I’m trying out <a href=\"https://parceljs.org\"><strong>Parcel.js</strong></a> for one of my most recent endeavours and I must say I’m quite loving it so far.

To solve for the cases where migrations run together(dev machines) or on servers where they are run separately I used <code>remove_index</code> if <code>index_exists?</code> .</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p> <p>This isn’t something “breaking or a huge discovery”, just something weird i found in my Rails Journey and something you should be aware about.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p><br /> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com/383/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com/383/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com&amp;blog=108096159&amp;post=383&amp;subd=learningstuffeveryday&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" />","published":"2018-01-12T11:29:15.000Z","author":"","link":"https://learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com/2018/01/12/rails-migrations-are-contextual/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"Rahul Jha: How to get started with self driving cars","content":"<h1 id=\"how-to-get-started-with-self-driving-cars\">How to get started with self driving cars?</h1> <p>I’ve asked myself (and Google) this question numerous times and have always learned something new in the process which in turn has lead to a superficial learning of autonomous technology — helping me getting a taste of it, but for a deeper knowledge on the subject, I must complete courseware, develop some projects for hands on experience and in the process network with people who have seasoned this art who can help me get a better insight on the current trends in research and industry.</p> <p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gYTE7HBbZokfRhXMDB7VUg.gif\" /></p> <h2 id=\"courseware\">COURSEWARE</h2> <p>I’ve completed my home work of figuring out a Coursework for conquering the world of Self Driving Cars:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://rj722.tech/deeplearning.ai\">Deep Learning specialisation</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://in.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373\">Artificial Intelligence for Robotics</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271\">Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344\">Intro to parallel Programming</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://rj722.tech/cs231n.stanford.edu\">CS231N</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/mobile-robot\">mobile-robot</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/underactuated-robotics-mitx-6-832x-0\">Underactuated robotics</a></li> <li>https://www.udacity.com/apollo (Yet to start)</li> </ul> <p>I haven’t included the Udacity self driving car Nanodegree program (although, it is a great resource) because it is quite expensive.

For example, if your todo list currently says - go on morning walk, a yet more effective way of saying this would be - Within 30 minutes of waking up, walk 1.5 kms. Therefore, I’ll try to be as clear as possible when posing a project statement.</p> <p>So, here’s the list of the projects I want to complete in the process:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Develop a brain for a self driving car</strong> <ul> <li>A neural network is to be implemented from scratch (no copy-pasting - typed in by hand) to spit out steering angle, gas and breaks given a frame of a road scene.</li> <li>It is encouraged to take help from related research papers.</li> <li>Any framework - TensorFlow, Torch, Caffe, etc may be used to implement this neural network.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Autonomous Driving Agent for GTA-5</strong> <ul> <li>GTA-5 in itself provides a rich environment for simulation and developing a self driving vehicle for the game would be quite educating and challenging.</li> <li>Implement a neural network which can completely navigate itself around on a particular road in GTA-5.</li> <li>You may retrain your prior project for the same!</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>A completely self driving RC car</strong> <ul> <li>It should be able to drive itself on any track (a circular one, no navigation decisions required), after 10 laps of training.</li> <li>The car should drive itself completely autonomously for at least 10 mins, and preferably until battery dies.</li> <li>Use whatever tech stack - donkey, Apollo, etc and hardware you wish to use.</li> <li>Complete this project with a physical car, not in simulation.</li> <li>It’s okay to collaborate with others on the project.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Plus, there would be lots of fun projects I’d be implementing from the curriculum of the various courses.</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"some-extra-fun-to-dos\">Some extra fun TO-DO’s:</h2> <ul> <li>Participate in the diyrobocar races, you can even participate in the upcoming transit olympics</li> <li>Join slack channels for donkey and Self Driving Car Nanodegree program from Udacity</li> <li>Try and make your friends interested in the same - we learn better in a group and grow better as a community.</li> <li>Go to meetups, network with like minded people and learn with them.</li> </ul> <p>I am pretty excited to dive in — let’s see how this would turn out to be!

(Image parts by freepik.com)</figcaption></figure> <p>(This post was crossposted with minor modifications <a href=\"https://medium.com/@gitmate_io/github-issue-notifications-on-open-source-projects-8104eb5c6e9b\">on medium</a>.)</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"ef0e\">Many Open Source Project maintainers suffer from a significant overdose of GitHub notifications. Many have turned them off completely for that.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5f6\"><a href=\"https://gitmate.io/\">We (GitMate.io)</a> are constantly researching about how people handle a flood of incoming issues in our aim to improve the situation by <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://gitmate.io/features\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">applying modern technologies</a> to the problem. (Oh and we love free software!)</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0e78\">By analyzing the biggest open source repositories on GitHub (more info on the data below) we’ve seen that the contributors to any of those projects responds to only 2.3% of all issues on average. (Let a contributor be a person that commented on at least two issues which they didn’t open.)</p> <figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"f4c5\"> <div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"> <div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div> <div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\"><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\" height=\"50\" width=\"75\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R4S6yIEqW1vNJ-S3Xx4R6Q.png\" /></div> </div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Contributor Interest Histogram (Summed over the biggest repositories)</figcaption></figure> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"69d5\">This makes clear that for any bigger open source project, “Watching” the repository is resulting in a lot of spam for most of the people. If they don’t respond, notifying them was of no value for the discussion after all.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d8d2\">We can also observe that only very few project managers care for any significant portion of the issues. Only 6 of our human contributors in total care for more than every 5th issue at all. Here’s our heros:</p> <pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"dffd\">25.05%: golang/go -&gt; ianlancetaylor, Watching 47.48%: moby/moby -&gt; thaJeztah, Watching 27.31%: moby/moby -&gt; cpuguy83, Watching 36.67%: owncloud/core -&gt; PVince81, Not watching 47.12%: saltstack/salt -&gt; gtmanfred, Watching 25.54%: saltstack/salt -&gt; Ch3LL, Watching</pre> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"d310\">However, we do see that 29.1% (117) of all contributors (402) are still subscribed to all notifications of the repository (watching it).</p> <h4 class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\" id=\"8105\">Switching to Polling</h4> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"aef0\">Many contributors switch to polling instead of watching the main repository.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2a2e\">However, we still see that the main maintainers keep watching the repository: without them, it’s very easy to miss out on new issues and it’s hard to make sure that the right people take a look at the right issues in a decentralized system.</p> <h4 class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\" id=\"f8d0\">Introducing Automation</h4> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"3a99\">In many communities we see home grown bots arising that apply labels and sometimes assign people based on keywords. This works especially well for automatically created issues (e.g. from <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://sentry.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sentry</a>) but is not a full solution.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e029\">We’ve tried it. Contributors started mentioning keywords consciously and it didn’t really work for user reported issues.</p> <h4 class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\" id=\"cb2a\">Better Automation!</h4> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"a947\">We wouldn’t be GitMate if we didn’t strive for more. Our data suggests that people are spending way too much time on their notifications. We’ve maintained <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://coala.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">coala.io</a> in the past and we know that reading through all of them is impossible even for core maintainers. Static keyword based automation doesn’t seem to be enough.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"35b4\">Since quite a while we’re hacking on an artificial intelligence that helps you dealing with this problem by analyzing exactly what every person in your team is discussing about on GitHub or GitLab and mentioning the ones who are important for solving any new issue.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bf53\">GitMate is built as a full automated triaging solution. Right now it already mentions related developers in new issues, finds duplicates, labels issues and closes old issues. It is already used by companies like <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://owncloud.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ownCloud</a> and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.kiwi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kiwi.com</a>and we’re looking for more beta testers.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bf29\">If you like this idea, visit <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://gitmate.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitMate.io</a> and shoot us an email to <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"mailto:lasse@gitmate.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lasse@gitmate.io</a> :).

We only wanted to look at the biggest ones (measured by scraped file size, i.e. roughly amount of text over all issues communicated). We’ve excluded ‘ZeroK-RTS/CrashReports’ because no humans seem to be operating that repository.

Although I was already a member of several small organizations, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/gitpoint\">GitPoint</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Chaosthebot\">ChaosTheBot</a> and my local FIRST Robotics Team, this is my first experience working with a really large organizations — in my case, <a href=\"https://github.com/coala\">coala</a>. It’s an amazing experience, so I’m incredibly grateful to <a href=\"https://g.co/gci\">Google Code-In</a> for the opportunity.</p><p>Working with everyone at coala has been fantastic. Not only have I been introduced to a wonderful and powerful code linter (which I’ve already started to implement into my existing code bases), I’ve also learned a ton about Python, unit tests, coala’s commit guidelines and probably most importantly, how to work in a large-scale team environment.</p><p>In the Google Code-In competition, students claim bite-sized “tasks” that usually involve solving a specific bug or adding a feature to one of their organization’s projects. Before “claiming” a task (committing to work on that specific issue) it’s generally good to research how you might go about it and what kinds of external tools or resources might be able to help you. For example, before I claimed a task involving the generation of an RSS feed for one of coala’s websites, I first found an NPM module that could easily create the feed and then read the documentation thoroughly to make sure I understood the module’s usage. At that point, I felt comfortable enough with the technology to claim the task.</p><p>If you are pushing yourself, eventually, you will run into a problem while solving a task. That’s totally fine. The mentors are there to help you overcome any barriers you may come across. I’ve ran into difficulties and had questions about a task several times, but contacting the coala mentors on Zulip or Gitter was very simple, and, after they get back to me quickly, we always work out a good solution. I’m very fortunate to have a huge team of mentors at coala who are willing to provide loads of feedback for even the smallest change, too. Learning directly from professionals in the programming industry has helped me become a better developer and improve my coding habits and abilities.</p><p>If you’re interested in coala, get involved by solving some newcomer issues. Once you’re comfortable, choose tasks in the coala repositories with a higher difficulty. The difficulty system set up in coala repositories is very helpful when you’re just starting off, as all issues are given a rating from newcomer, to low, to medium, to high, and you can pick and choose the issues with a rating you’re comfortable with.</p><p>Overall, coala has given me a stronger appreciation for all open source software, developers and maintainers while also helping me improve my own programming abilities. I’m very happy to be a member of the team and look forward to continuing to work with them well after this year’s Google Code-In competition is complete. Who knows, maybe in a few years I’ll be able to mentor the next generation of coala developers in their Google Code-In journey, and hopefully help them have just as good of a time as I’ve been having.</p><img height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=174c83855630\" width=\"1\" />","published":"2017-12-27T10:22:03.000Z","author":"","link":"https://medium.com/@andrewda/mid-google-code-in-thoughts-174c83855630?source=rss-6213d9ba759b------2","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}}]
