Writing them by hand can however be quite error prone if there are many member variables to consider. Missing a single one of them will still compile and mostly work fine, apart from some hard to debug corner cases, such as misbehaving or crashing algorithms and containers, or data loss. Can we do better?</p> <h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3> <p>In <a href=\"https://phabricator.kde.org/source/kitinerary/\">KItinerary</a> we have a number of classes representing <a href=\"https://schema.org\">schema.org</a> types. Those are fairly straightforward value types with a number of properties, to be consumed both statically (by C++ code) and dynamically (by QML, Grantlee and JSON-LD de/serialization).</p> <p>As implementing getters, setters, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Q_PROPERTY</code> statements, member variables, etc for about a hundred or so properties by hand would result in an unreasonable amount of boilerplate code, this is all done by a macro (<a href=\"https://phabricator.kde.org/source/kitinerary/browse/master/src/datatypes/flight.h\">example</a>).</p> <p>So far so good, but now we&#8217;d like to add comparison operators for those types. Specifically we needed <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">operator==</code> for optimizing away some memory allocations in case of non-changing write operations (similar to the common pattern of not emitting change signals in setter methods on non-changes). But the thoughts below are of course also applicable to any other comparison function, not just equality.</p> <h3 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h3> <p>Ideally we&#8217;d find an alternatives to writing the comparison functions by hand that would either be impossible to break or would at least not fail silently (e.g. by producing compiler errors).</p> <h4 id=\"qmetaproperty\">QMetaProperty</h4> <p>One idea would be to implement the comparison functions entirely generically by leveraging the property iteration support in <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">QMetaObject</code>. That is we iterate over all properties with the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">STORED</code> flag and compare their values. This gets the job done, but has two drawbacks:</p> <ul> <li>Comparison happens via <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">QVariant</code>, which means we have to register comparison operators for all types with the meta type system. That might actually be nice to have anyway, but it is limited to less-than and equal.</li> <li>All property values are passed through <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">QVariant</code>, which in some situations can have a relevant performance impact, in particular when using types that are too large for inline storage inside <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">QVariant</code> (causing allocations).</li> </ul> <h4 id=\"more-preprocessor-magic\">More preprocessor magic</h4> <p>Another idea could be to use more elaborate preprocessor constructs that allow for iteration over all properties. The <a href=\"https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/preprocessor/doc/index.html\">Boost.Preprocessor</a> library has the building blocks for this. From experience in an old pre-C++11 <a href=\"https://github.com/kdab/sqlate\">project attempting to catch SQL errors at compile time</a> this works but doesn&#8217;t really lead to a nice syntax nor easily maintainable code.</p> <h4 id=\"a-clever-overloading-trick-from-verdigris\">A clever overloading trick from Verdigris</h4> <p>The solution I ended up using is inspired by Woboq&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/woboq/verdigris\">Verdigris</a>. The basic idea is that each property macro generates a part of the comparison function only, the comparison for its property and a call to the comparison function for the previous property. The chaining is done by overloading on a template type that essentially describes a numerical value by inheritance. A little <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">constexpr</code> helper functions allows us to determine the index of a property at compile time. Olivier describes this in more detail in his <a href=\"https://woboq.com/blog/verdigris-implementation-tricks.html\">blog post about Verdigris implementation details</a>.</p> <p>The resulting code for KItinerary can be found <a href=\"https://phabricator.kde.org/source/kitinerary/browse/master/src/datatypes/datatypes_p.h\">here</a>. It&#8217;s worth noting that while this might look inefficient due to the many function calls, this is all inline code in a single translation unit, so in an optimized build this ends up essentially as the hand-written comparison function would look like.</p> <h3 id=\"language-support\">Language support?</h3> <p>Would it make sense to have C++ support something like <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">bool operator==(const T&amp;) const = default</code>, that is let the compiler generate the implementation for us, as it can for a number of other member functions? <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/Jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4126.htm\">Proposals</a> for such a language extension exist.</p> <p>There&#8217;s a bigger conceptual problem though, that one runs immediately into once the comparison operator is implemented: the semantics of comparing things. Here are a few examples:</p> <ul> <li>Floating point numbers: how close together is &#8220;equal&#8221; depends on what those numbers represent, in my case of geo coordinates anything within a few meters is certainly more than enough. And there is the little detail that <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NAN</code> does not compare equal to itself, which isn&#8217;t what KItinerary needed either, as NAN is its indicator for &#8220;value not set&#8221;.</li> <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">QString</code>: here the default equal comparison doesn&#8217;t distinguish between null and empty strings. That&#8217;s probably very often what you&#8217;d expect, unless you put special semantics on that distinction, such as in the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NAN</code> case above.</li> <li>Date/time values: two <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">QDateTime</code> instances compare equal if they refer to the same point in time, not if they represent exactly the same information (e.g. time specified with an UTC offset vs a full IANA timezone). For KItinerary timezones are a very crucial information, so the default semantic doesn&#8217;t cut it there.</li> </ul> <p>An all-or-nothing approach for compiler-generated comparison operator implementations means it&#8217;s not a viable option in case one needs more control over the semantics. That of course does not mean it is useless, but it does mean the alternative implementation techniques remain valid either way.</p>","published":"2018-11-10T09:15:00.000Z","author":"Volker Krause","link":"https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2018/11/10/cxx-auto-generated-comparison-operators.html","feed":{"source":"http://planetKDE.org/rss20.xml","link":"http://planetKDE.org/","name":"Planet KDE"}},{"title":"KDE Applications 18.12 branches created","content":"<p>Make sure you commit anything you want to end up in the 18.12 release to them <br /><br />We're already past the dependency freeze.<br /><br />The Freeze and Beta is this Thursday 15 of November.<br /><br />More interesting dates<br /> November 29: KDE Applications 18.12 RC (18.11.90) Tagging and Release<br /> December 6: KDE Applications 18.12 Tagging<br /> December 13: KDE Applications 18.12 Release<br /><br /><a href=\"https://community.kde.org/Schedules/Applications/18.12_Release_Schedule\">https://community.kde.org/Schedules/Applications/18.12_Release_Schedule</a><br />","published":"2018-11-09T22:31:23.000Z","author":"Albert Astals Cid (TSDgeos)","link":"https://tsdgeos.blogspot.com/2018/11/kde-applications-1812-branches-created.html","feed":{"source":"http://planetKDE.org/rss20.xml","link":"http://planetKDE.org/","name":"Planet KDE"}},{"title":"FPgM report: 2018-45","content":"<img width=\"766\" height=\"324\" src=\"https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fpgm-report-766x324.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Fedora Program Manager weekly report on Fedora Project development and progress\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fpgm-report-766x324.jpg 766w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fpgm-report-300x127.jpg 300w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fpgm-report-768x325.jpg 768w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fpgm-report-1024x433.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /><p>Here&#8217;s your report of what has happened in Fedora Program Management this week.<br></p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve set up <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/calendar/council/2018/10/10/#m9314\">weekly office hours</a> in #fedora-meeting-1 (<em>note a change in channel</em>).

This concept described how heterosexuality is assumed, enforced and viewed as an obligation regardless of one’s own sexual preferences, and it was the subject of one of the articles that members of the <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_LGBT%2B/Portal\">LGBT user group</a> wrote about in different languages in Stockholm, Sweden, last August.</p>\n<p>The event was organized by a group of Wikimedians coming from Asia, Africa, and Europe, all united by one single cause: promoting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT\">LGBT</a> Culture and achievements online. For four days in August, 12 participants took part in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europride\">EuroPride</a> 2018 in Stockholm. In two days of editing, the participants created, translated, and improved over 80 LGBT-related Wikipedia articles in more than 10 languages, in addition to adding over 300 photos. They also participated in a human rights summit, and the user group walked in a pride parade for the first time. For some participants, it was the first time they had the chance to walk in a pride parade in their life, as they don&#8217;t exist in their home countries.</p>\n<p>The meeting gave LGBT user group members the opportunity to meet and exchange their personal experiences both inside and outside the Wikimedia movement. They also strategized about how they could support one another through an international network. Next year, two similar events will be organized in Vienna for EuroPride and New York for World Pride.</p>\n<p>We talked with two organizers of the Stockholm event: Houssem Abida and Saskia Ehlers. If you&#8217;d like to contribute to making the flag more visible on Wikipedia, join the <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_Loves_Pride\">Wiki Loves Pride</a> initiative.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s the current state of LGBT content on Wikipedia? Where is it strong, and where is it weak?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Houssem Abida</strong>: I think LGBT content needs a lot of work on Wikipedia, especially in some specific languages. For example, you can find articles that cover almost all sexual concepts in English, but it is very hard to find them in Arabic. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_king\">drag kings</a> are a very basic concept in LGBT culture, but they didn&#8217;t exist on the Arabic Wikipedia before the Stockholm edit-a-thon.</p>\n<p>Also, many important activists are still not showcased enough through the platform; it is our role to write about them.</p>\n<p>That said, I think a strong point of Wikipedia is that it gives a relatively good and updated general overview of the situation LGBT people are living in every country (through the articles &#8220;LGBT in X&#8221;).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong>How does the emerging <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017\">Wikimedia 2030</a> strategy fit with improving coverage of LGBT topics on Wikipedia?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Houssem Abida: </strong>I think the strategy is very supportive to our case and in fighting for it. For example, the way it emphasizes partnerships is very important for us and makes our work stronger and structured (NGOs provide references and documents, help with logistics, help us access difficult communities, etc.). Also, focusing on local communities is something we need, as it provides us with deeper communication channels and allows to reach a bigger and more vulnerable community (when it comes for the sexual education role that Wikipedia plays, for example).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong>What gave you the idea to combine EuroPride with peace advocacy?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Saskia Ehlers: </strong>This is a somewhat longer story. My grandparents met through a peace organization after World War II. They took part in workcamps where they rebuilt churches and houses with teams of young people from different countries that had previously been at war. The intention of those kinds of exchanges and organizations was for the participants to get to know each other&#8217;s cultures and become friends, so that it would in the future it would not be possible to blindly hate and slaughter people just because they had another nationality, culture, or spoke another language.</p>\n<p>When the time came I became active in such an organization as well. I was a camp leader and organizer in Germany and other countries. Through that I met Thomas Schallhart from Austria, who was like me active within the Wikimedia movement and the same peace organization. We decided to combine both passions in the <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/07/13/digest-wikipedia-for-peace/\">Wikipedia for Peace</a> project. In this, young people from different countries came together to write about a certain peace related topic on Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>I had organized a <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_for_Peace_Madrid_World_Pride\">LGBT-related Wikimedia event in Madrid in 2017</a> because the World Pride took place there then. It was truly great and very fruitful, so I wanted to repeat this in Stockholm—and as Thomas had lived in Sweden for several years, we had the necessary connections to make that idea a reality.</p>\n<p>The reason why we see writing about LGBT issues as a topic suitable for the Wikipedia for Peace format is that aside from nationality, culture, and language barriers, people are also excluded or hated because of their sexual preferences. Both Thomas and I have experienced that personally. This format gives us the chance to spread knowledge in different language versions, and through education create tolerance and awareness. In Madrid, for example, participants wrote the first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyz_language\">Kyrgysz</a> Wikipedia article on sexual diversity. On the other hand people can have human exchanges and gain understanding through this. One thing that I can think about here is how one person in Madrid described how and why they had bullied homosexuals in their youth, and how the phenomenon is very present in their culture until today. That same person continued to work on the topic after the event was finished. I think that these events and sharing experiences with very different people can change a person&#8217;s mind and life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong>How did you decide what topics to cover at the Stockholm edit-a-thon?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Saskia Ehlers: </strong>People had different ideas on what to write about, so at the end we covered a wide variety of topics. One person for example promised to their bisexual friend that they would write about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphobia\">biphobia</a> in their language as there is sometimes discrimination within the LGBT community towards bisexuals. Another person who is a doctor in real life wrote about sex change surgery. We had a reflection round each day and talked about what each person wrote about during the day. So people also gave each other ideas and influenced each other on what to write about. We also had input in terms of talks from participants. In one talk different gender concepts from all over the world were mentioned, which led one participant to write about the Southern Mexican concept for the third gender Muxe. We took part in the human rights summit in which important activists and speakers from different countries were present. One of them was Sedef Çakmak who was the first openly gay politician to be elected into office in Turkey. Some people wrote about her in their language versions. We also took a picture of her at the summit, which is now included in her article.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong>Have you run into any difficulties? If so, what?</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s somewhat difficult to finance and organize such international exchanges through Wikimedia funds. Conference grants don&#8217;t really fit because the projects are designed to be low budget. Travel costs can only be reimbursed from chapters with a lot of money for community support, such as Germany, Switzerland or Austria. All of means that it is a lot harder for people from poorer countries or regions with no user groups or chapters to participate. This made the financing and logistics somewhat difficult and time consuming. A rapid grant alone is not sufficient to cover the flights, accommodation, and food costs during the event. Another kind grant to organize such exchanges like a European fund would be great. We proposed this idea at Wikimania in Cape Town.</p>\n<p>Aside from that we&#8217;d like to thank the Austrian, German and Swedish chapter for the financial and in kind support of the event.</p>\n<p><em>As told to Ed Erhart, Senior Editorial Associate, Communications</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>This interview has been minimally edited.</em></p>\n","published":"2018-11-09T17:41:38.000Z","author":"Saskia Ehlers, Houssem Abida and Ed Erhart","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/11/09/europride-stockholm/","feed":{"source":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/feed/","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org","name":"Wikimedia Foundation"}},{"title":"Freenode#live post","content":"<p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_1994\" style=\"width: 160px;\"><a href=\"https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/english.jpg\"><img alt=\"Photo of a KDE Slimbook and a pint\" class=\"wp-image-1994 size-thumbnail\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/english-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Slimbook and a pint of Cider</p></div> <p>The weekend of 3 and 4 November Dave and I went to staff the KDE booth at <a href=\"https://freenode.live/\">Freenode#live</a>, in Bristol.

Sitting down with a Slimbook and a pint can be quite productive; I got some Calamares fixes done before the conference.</p> <div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_1995\" style=\"width: 160px;\"><a href=\"https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kde-stand.jpg\"><img alt=\"Photo of table with KDE logos\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1995\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kde-stand-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our stand, before visitors arrived</p></div> <p>We (as in the KDE community) have invested into getting booth materials ready for this kind of events, so we quickly had Konqui peeking at visitors and Plasma running on a range of devices (no Power9 this week, though). Dave had 3D-printed a KDE logo we stuck to the top of the monitor, and had a pile of leaflets and stickers (KDE, neon, Krita, GCompris, and some Wiki To Learn) to hand out.</p> <p>Next to our stand was <a href=\"https://www.minetest.net/\">MineTest</a>, with a demo and they sat hacking at the code of the game for most of the weekend. On the other side, <a href=\"https://freenode.net/\">Freenode</a> themselves were handing our IRC.horse stickers and other goodies.</p> <div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_1992\" style=\"width: 160px;\"><a href=\"https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/conference.jpg\"><img alt=\"Photo of Dave talking with people\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1992\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/conference-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The hallway track</p></div> <p>A conference booth isn&#8217;t just about giving away goodies, though, and we spent the weekend, 9-to-5, talking with people about the KDE community and its software products. Plasma could be seen &#8212; and played with &#8212; on the machines we had at hand, and we did some small application demo&#8217;s. As usual, people told us they used i3 &#8212; and our response as usual is that Free Software on the desktop is better than non-free software. Some people had last used KDE in 2010 or so, so we could show how the different parts now operate independently and more flexibly &#8212; and how Plasma is now pretty darn lightweight.</p> <p>Here in the photo is Dave extolling the virtues of something. (I&#8217;ve edited the photo to make some people in the background un-recognizable by pasting Dave&#8217;s eyeball over their faces &#8212; I forgot to ask permission to post)</p> <div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_1996\" style=\"width: 160px;\"><a href=\"https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/open-source-business.jpg\"><img alt=\"Photo of stage with presentation\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1996\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/open-source-business-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Conference track</p></div> <p>.. and a conference isn&#8217;t just about the booths and vendor stands, either. It&#8217;s about the talks. Here&#8217;s one I sat in on about business models and how licensing affects the available models (in particular with reference to recent license changes in some projects). The KDE community is interesting because it&#8217;s not one-community-one-company like a lot that I see. We have a collection of small and medium companies building on, and building with, the KDE community&#8217;s software products. I think that&#8217;s healthy and generally happy. No licensing gotcha&#8217;s for us when using Qt under the LGPL version 2.1 and KDE&#8217;s Frameworks also under the LGPL.</p> <p>Two talks I would like to single out are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znkhCbnGuXU\">Leslie Hawthorn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV9Vt4knqsc\">VM Brasseur</a>, (those are YouTube links). Neither are technical talks, but social talks, about what we (as Free Software contributors) do and why, and social issues we all face &#8212; and how to bring Software Freedom to more people.</p> <p>A concept I didn&#8217;t know existed was <em>platform shaming</em>. See above: there&#8217;s lots of ways to use Free Software from the KDE community, in combination with i3, or on Windows, and on Free Software operating systems. Those are all OK.</p> <div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_1993\" style=\"width: 160px;\"><a href=\"https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dave-at-work.jpg\"><img alt=\"Photo of Dave with laptop\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1993\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dave-at-work-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bugfixing Dave</p></div> <p>I&#8217;d like to thank Dave for being a great booth- room- and dinner-mate, and Christel and the Freenode#live crew for a wonderful well-organized weekend.

While writing this I will be following the instructions myself for an architecture I haven&#8217;t done this for before.</em></p> <p>The secret is of course QEMU, but to make testing easier I will set it up so that QEMU doesn&#8217;t simulate an entire system, but runs foreign applications as if they were native inside my existing X11 desktop. This is possible through the qemu-user binaries, which can run statically linked executables or dynamically linked ones if you are in a properly set up chroot.</p> <h2>Setting up chroot</h2> <p>So how do you get this properly set up chroot? There are various ways depending on the Linux distro. I personally use Debian, and the instructions here will be almost identical to what is done on Ubuntu. If you use Suse or RedHat, I know you can find official guidelines on setting up a chroot for qemu.</p> <p>First, get the dependencies&#160;(as root or sudo) :<code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> apt-get install binfmt-support qemu qemu-user-static debootstrap<br /> </code></p> <p>Most of these are just the tools needed, and binfmt-support is configuration glue what will make Linux launch ELF executables with non-native architectures using qemu, which is another piece of the magic puzzle.</p> <p>For my example I am testing while writing this, I will be targeting the IBM mainframe architecture S/390x and will also need the cross-building tools for that as well. I can get all of those on Debian by just pulling in the right cross-building g++ (as root or sudo) :<code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> apt-get install g++-s390x-linux-gnu<br /> </code></p> <p>S/390x is interesting for me because Debian dropped official support for big endian PPC64, so I need a new way of testing that Qt works on 64bit big-endian platforms.</p> <p>Now go to where you want your sysroots installed, and run debootstrap. Debootstrap is the Debian tool for downloading and installing a Debian image into a sub-directory<br /> (as root or sudo) :<code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> debootstrap stable --arch s390x stable debian-s390x http://deb.debian.org/debian/<br /> </code></p> <p>Next prepare it for being a chroot system&#160;(as root or sudo) :<code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> mount --rbind /dev debian-s390x/dev/<br /> mount --rbind /sys debian-s390x/sys/<br /> mount --rbind /proc debian-s390x/proc/<br /> </code></p> <p>Enter the chroot&#160;(as root or sudo) :<code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> chroot debian-s390x<br /> </code></p> <p>If you run &#8216;uname -a&#8217; here you will now get something like:<code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> Linux hostname 4.x.x-x-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.x.x-x (2018-x-x) s390x GNU/Linux<br /> </code></p> <p>In other words, a native AMD64 kernel with x390x userland! Every command you execute here will be using s390x binaries in the chroot, but using the native kernel for system calls. If you launch an X11 app, it will be using the X11-server running natively on your machine already.</p> <h2>Prepare chroot to be a sysroot</h2> <p>To build Qt, we also need all the Qt dependencies inside the chroot. In Debian we can do that using &#8216;apt-get build-dep&#8217;.</p> <p>Edit debian-s390x/etc/apt/sources.list and add a deb-src line, such as: <code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian stable main<br /> </code></p> <p>Install the Qt dependencies (inside chroot as root):<code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> apt-get update<br /> apt-get build-dep qtbase-opensource-src<br /> </code></p> <p>Finally, for the setup we need to make sure it works a sysroot for cross-building by replacing absolute links to system libraries with relative ones that work both inside and outside the chroot&#160;(inside chroot as root):<code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> apt-get install symlinks<br /> cd /usr/lib/<br /> symlink -rc .<br /> </code></p> <h2>Building Qt</h2> <p>We can now build Qt for this sysroot. If you want to test you own applications, you could also install&#160;an official prebuilt Qt version from Debian, and build against that.</p> <p>Configuring Qt for cross-building to a platform like that looks like this on Debian, and only needs a few changes to work on other platforms: <code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> $QTSRC/configure -prefix /opt/qt-s390x -release -force-debug-info \\<br /> -system-freetype -fontconfig -no-opengl \\<br /> -device linux-generic-g++ -sysroot /sysroots/debian-s390x \\<br /> -device-option CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/s390x-linux-gnu-<br /> </code></p> <p>You can remove the -no-opengl argument if you want to test OpenGL using the mesa software implementation, but otherwise I don&#8217;t recommend using OpenGL inside the chroot.</p> <p>If everything is setup correctly you don&#8217;t need to specify &#8216;-system-freetype -fontconfig&#8217;. It is just there to catch failures in pkg-config, so we don&#8217;t end up building a Qt version that requires manually bundling fonts.</p> <p>In general cross-compiling with Qt always looks similar to the above, but note that if you are cross-building to ARM32, it looks a little bit different: <code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> $QTSRC/configure -prefix /opt/qt-armhf -release -force-debug-info \\<br /> -system-freetype -fontconfig -no-opengl \\<br /> -device linux-arm-generic-g++ -sysroot /sysroots/debian-armhf \\<br /> -device-option DISTRO_OPTS=hard-float \\<br /> -device-option COMPILER_FLAGS='-march=armv7-a -mfpu=neon' \\<br /> -device-option CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-<br /> </code></p> <p>Notice that ARM32 has a specific device name (linux-arm-generic-g++ instead of linux-generic-g++) and needs to have a floating-point mode set. Additionally, for older embedded architectures, it is generally a good idea to specify COMPILER_FLAGS to select a specific architecture. You need to pass compiler flags as a device-option, because the normal way of specifying QMAKE_CFLAGS and QMAKE_CXXFLAGS after configure options sets the host compiler flags, not the target compiler flags. If you need more complicated options, you should make your own qmake device target. You can always base it of linux-generic-g++ for good defaults.</p> <p>With Qt configured like this, you can build it as usual and run make install to have the libraries installed into the /opt directory under the chroot.</p> <p>Issue encountered; as I built qtbase, I hit a linking error: <code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> qt5/qtbase/src/corelib/global/qrandom.cpp:143: error: undefined reference to 'getentropy'<br /> </code></p> <p>The problem turns out to be that my cross-building tools have libc6 2.27 while the sysroot has libc6 2.24. The best thing to do would be using the same libc version on both sides. However, as they are fully compatible, except for newer features in one, I chose to just disable this feature in Qt. I accomplished this by&#160;calling the configure command again, this time with -no-feature-getentropy added.</p> <p>With this change, everything I tried building built and installed without further issues.</p> <h2>Run a Qt application</h2> <p>To get some examples to test, go to the folder of the example in the build tree and run &#8216;make install&#8217;. For instance, my standard example for widgets: <code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> cd qtbase/examples/widgets/richtext/textedit<br /> make install<br /> </code></p> <p>Then&#160;(inside chroot as root, assuming you have created a testuser):<code style=\"font-size: 90%;\"><br /> su - testuser<br /> export DISPLAY=:0<br /> export QT_XCB_NO_MITSHM=1<br /> /opt/qt-s390x/examples/widgets/richtext/textedit/textedit -platform xcb<br /> </code></p> <p>And it just works&#8230;<br /> The -platform xcb argument is needed because the default for embedded builds is using the eglfs QPA. I am assuming you are developing on X11 and want the jaw-dropping experience of having a foreign architecture Qt application just launch like a normal Qt app.</p> <p>In this setup, the applications running in QEMU will be much faster than under a full system emulation, because the kernel and the X11 server are still the native ones, and thus running at normal speed.&#160;However,&#160;for X11 it means sometimes having a few oddities, as there can be client-server mismatch in endianness. While it is supposed to be supported, it is such an edge case that it often has issues. This is the reason why QT_XCB_NO_MITSHM=1 is set. Otherwise, we would hit an issue with passing file descriptors between client and server, which is likely a bug in libxcb. If we were testing a little-endian architecture like arm64 or riscv instead, the environment variable would not be needed.</p> <p>So that is it, quite a few steps, but most only done once. And as I wrote this, I followed the same instructions for a rather uncommon and not officially supported platform, and only hit two issues with easy work-arounds.</p> <p>The post <a href=\"https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/11/09/testing-qt-emulated-architectures-using-qemu-user-mode/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Testing Qt on Emulated Architectures Using QEMU User Mode</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://blog.qt.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">Qt Blog</a>.</p>","published":"2018-11-09T08:05:15.000Z","author":"Qt Dev Loop","link":"https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/11/09/testing-qt-emulated-architectures-using-qemu-user-mode/","feed":{"source":"http://planetKDE.org/rss20.xml","link":"http://planetKDE.org/","name":"Planet KDE"}},{"title":"Why are the PM10 particles of the Purpleair monitor biased so high?","content":"<img src='https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/023/444/original/Screenshot_20180204-101546_2.png' alt='PublicLab'> <br />","published":"2018-11-09T00:37:14.000Z","author":"Cbarnes9","link":"https://publiclab.org/notes/Cbarnes9/11-09-2018/why-are-the-pm10-particles-of-the-purpleair-monitor-biased-so-high","feed":{"source":"https://publiclab.org/feed.rss","link":"https://publiclab.org/feed.rss","name":"Recent research notes on PublicLab.org"}},{"title":"What type of aerosol was used for the calibration of the purpleair lasers?","content":"<img src='https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/023/444/original/Screenshot_20180204-101546_2.png' alt='PublicLab'> <br />","published":"2018-11-09T00:33:31.000Z","author":"Cbarnes9","link":"https://publiclab.org/notes/Cbarnes9/11-09-2018/what-type-of-aerosol-was-used-for-the-calibration-of-the-purpleair-lasers","feed":{"source":"https://publiclab.org/feed.rss","link":"https://publiclab.org/feed.rss","name":"Recent research notes on PublicLab.org"}},{"title":"Does particle composition that the purple air monitors measure greatly skew the data output?","content":"<img src='https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/023/444/original/Screenshot_20180204-101546_2.png' alt='PublicLab'> <br />","published":"2018-11-09T00:29:24.000Z","author":"Cbarnes9","link":"https://publiclab.org/notes/Cbarnes9/11-09-2018/does-particle-composition-that-the-purple-air-monitors-measure-greatly-skew-the-data-output","feed":{"source":"https://publiclab.org/feed.rss","link":"https://publiclab.org/feed.rss","name":"Recent research notes on PublicLab.org"}},{"title":"Material del Taller de gvSIG aplicado a Geología de las 14as Jornadas gvSIG disponible","content":"[object Object]","published":"2018-11-08T22:34:04.000Z","author":"Mario","link":"https://blog.gvsig.org/2018/11/09/material-del-taller-de-gvsig-aplicado-a-geologia-de-las-14as-jornadas-gvsig-disponible/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"French Krita book – 2nd edition","content":"<p>(Post in french, english version below)</p> <p>Le mois dernier est sorti la seconde &#233;dition de mon livre &#8220;Dessin et peinture num&#233;rique avec Krita&#8221;.

We came up with a rough outline of things that we want to work on over the next year or so. This is a small list of tasks that we think will have a good impact on the image of AcousticBrainz and encourage people to use our data more.</p>\n<h2>State of AcousticBrainz</h2>\n<p>AcousticBrainz has a <a href=\"https://acousticbrainz.org/statistics-graph\">huge database of submissions</a> (over 10 million now, thanks everyone!), but we are currently not using the wealth of data to our advantage. For the last year we’ve not had a core developer from MetaBrainz or MTG working on existing or new features in AcousticBrainz. However, we now have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/paramsingh\">Param</a>, who is including AcousticBrainz in his role with MetaBrainz</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rsh7\">Rashi</a>, who <a href=\"https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2018/08/12/gsoc-2018-more-detailed-integration-of-acousticbrainz-with-musicbrainz/\">worked on AcousticBrainz for <abbr title=\"Google Summer of Code\">GSoC</abbr></a> and is going to continue working with us</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/philtgun\">Philip</a>, who is starting a PhD at MTG, focused on some of the algorithms/data going into AcousticBrainz</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alastair\">Alastair</a>, who now has more time to put towards management of the project</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of this, we&#8217;re glad to present an outline of our next tasks for AcousticBrainz:</p>\n<h2>Short-term</h2>\n<p>Some small tasks that are quick to finish and we can use to show off uses of the data in AcousticBrainz</p>\n<h3>Merge Philip’s similarity, including an API endpoint</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1479769\">Philip’s masters thesis</a> project from last year uses PostgreSQL search to find acoustically similar recordings to a target recording. This uses the features in AcousticBrainz. We need to ensure that PostgreSQL can handle the scale of data that we have.</p>\n<p>An extension of this work is to use the similarity to allow us to remove bad duplicate submissions (we can take all recordings with the same MBID and see if they are similar to each other, if one is not similar we can assume that it’s not actually the same as the other duplicates, and mark it as bad). We want to make these results available via an API too, so that others can check this information as well.</p>\n<h3>Merge Existing PRs</h3>\n<p>We have <a href=\"https://github.com/metabrainz/acousticbrainz-server/pulls\">many great <abbr title=\"pull requests\">PRs</abbr></a> from various people which Alastair didn’t merge over the last year. We&#8217;re going to spend some time getting these patches merged to show that we’re open to contributions!</p>\n<h3>Publish our Existing models</h3>\n<p>In research at MTG we’ve come up with a few more detailed genre models based on tag/genre data that we’ve collected from a number of sources. We believe that these models can be more useful that the current genre models that we have. The AcousticBrainz infrastructure supports adding new models easily, so we should spend some time integrating these. There are a few tasks that need to be done to make sure that these work</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that high-level dumps will dump this new data (If we have an existing high-level dump we need to make a new one including the new data)</li>\n<li>Ensure that we compute high-level data for all old submissions (we currently don’t have a system to go back and compute high-level data for old submissions with a new model, the high-level extractor has to be improved to support this)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Update/fix some pages</h3>\n<p>We have a number of issues reported about unclear text on some pages and grammar that we can improve. Especially important are</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/AB-373\">API description</a> (we should remove the documentation from the main website and just have a link to <a href=\"https://acousticbrainz.readthedocs.io/\">the ReadTheDocs page</a>)</li>\n<li>Front page (Show off what we have in the project in more detail, instead of just a wall of text)</li>\n<li>Data page (instead of just showing tables of data, try and work out a better way of presenting the information that we have)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fix Picard plugin</h3>\n<p>When AB was down during our migration we were serving HTML from our API pages, which caused Picard to crash if the AB plugin was enabled while trying to get AB data. This should be an easy fix in the Picard plugin.</p>\n<h2>High Impact</h2>\n<p>These are tasks that we want to complete first, that we know will have a high impact on the quality of the data that we produce.</p>\n<h3>Frame-level data</h3>\n<p>We want to extract and store more detailed information about our recordings. This relies on working being done in MTG to develop a new extractor to allow us to get more detailed information. It will also give us other improvements to data that we have in AB that we know is bad. This data is much bigger than our current data when stored in JSON (hundreds of times larger), so we need to develop a more efficient way of storing submissions. This could involve storing the data in a well-known binary data exchange format. A bunch of subtasks for this project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finish the essentia extractor software</li>\n<li>Decide on how to store items on the server (file format, store on disk instead of database)</li>\n<li>Work out a way to deal with features from two versions of the extractor (do we keep accepting old data? What happens if someone requests data for a recording for which we have the old extractor data but not the new one?)</li>\n<li>Upgrade clients to support this (Change to HTTPS, change to the new API URL structure, ensure that clients check before submission if they’re the latest version, work out how to compress data or perform a duplicate check before submission)</li>\n<li>Deduplication (If we have much larger data files, don’t bother storing 200 copies for a single Beatles song if we find that we already have 5-10 submissions that are all the same)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>MusicBrainz Metadata</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2018/08/12/gsoc-2018-more-detailed-integration-of-acousticbrainz-with-musicbrainz/\">Rashi’s GSoC project</a> in 2018 helped us to replicate parts of the MusicBrainz database into AcousticBrainz. This allows us to do amazing things like keep up-to-date information about MBID redirects, and do search/browse/filtering of data based on relationships such as Artists just by making a simple database query. We want to merge this work and start using it.</p>\n<h3>Dumps</h3>\n<p>When we changed the database architecture of AcousticBrainz in 2015 we stopped making data dumps, making people rely on using the API to retrieve data. This is not scalable, and many people have asked for this data. We want to fix all of the outstanding issues that we’ve found in the current dumps system and start producing periodic dumps for people to download.</p>\n<h3>Build more models</h3>\n<p>In addition to the existing models that we’ve already built (see above, “Publish our Existing models”), we have been collecting a lot of metadata that we could use to make even more high-level models which we think will have a value in the community. Build these models and publicly release them, using our current machine learning framework.</p>\n<h2>Wishlist</h2>\n<p>These are tasks that we want to complete that will show off the data that we have in AcousticBrainz and allow us to do more things with the data, but should come after the high-impact tasks.</p>\n<h3>Expose AB data on MusicBrainz</h3>\n<p>As part of the process to cross-pollinate the brainz’s, we want to be able to show a small subset of AB data that we trust on the MB website. This could include information such as <abbr title=\"beats per minute\">BPM</abbr>, Key, and results from some of our high-level models.</p>\n<h3>Improve music playback</h3>\n<p>On the detail page for recordings we currently have a simple YouTube player which tries to find a recording by doing text search. We want to improve the reliability and functionality of this player to include other playback services and take advantage of metadata that we already have in the MusicBrainz database.</p>\n<h3>Scikit-learn models</h3>\n<p>The future of machine learning is moving towards deep learning, and our current high-level infrastructure written in the custom Gaia project by MTG is preventing us from integrating improved machine learning algorithms to the data that we have. We would like to rewrite the training/evaluation process using <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/\">scikit-learn</a>, which is a well known Python library for general machine learning tasks. This will make it easier for us to take advantage of improvements in machine learning, and also make our environment more approachable to people outside the MusicBrainz community.</p>\n<h3>Dataset editor improvements</h3>\n<p>Part of the high-level/machine learning process involves making datasets that can be used to train models. We have a basic tool for building datasets, however it is difficult to use for making large datasets. We should look into ways of making this tool more useful for people who want to contribute datasets to AcousticBrainz.</p>\n<h3>Search</h3>\n<p>With the integration of the MusicBrainz database into AcousticBrainz, we will be able to let people search for metadata related to items which we know only exist in AcousticBrainz. We think that this is a good way for people to explore the data, and also for people to make new datasets (see above). We also want to provide a way that lets people search for feature data in the database (e.g. “all recordings in the key of Am, between 100 and 110BPM”).</p>\n<h3>API updates</h3>\n<p>As part of the 2018 MetaBrainz summit we decided to unify the structure of the APIs, including root path and versioning. We should make AcousticBrainz follow this common plan, while also supporting clients who still access the current API.</p>\n<p>We should become more in-line with the MetaBrainz policy of API access, including user-agent reporting, rate limiting, and API key use.</p>\n<h3>Request specific data</h3>\n<p>Many services who use the API only need a very small bit of information from a specific recording, and so it’s often not efficient to return the entire low-level or high-level JSON document. It would be nice for clients to be able to request a specific field(s) for a recording. This ties in with the “Expose AcousticBrainz data on MusicBrainz” task above.</p>\n<h3>Everything else</h3>\n<p>Fix all our bugs and make AcousticBrainz an amazing open tool for MIR research.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Thanks for reading!

This release fixes one security issue as well as bugs reported over the last three months.</p> <p>All users using the affected versions of PostgreSQL should update as soon as possible. Please see the notes on \"Updating\" below for any post-update steps that may be required if you are using <code>pg_stat_statements</code> in your installation.</p> <p>This update is also the final release for PostgreSQL 9.3, which is now end-of-life and will no longer receive any bug or security fixes. If your environment still uses PostgreSQL 9.3, please make plans to update to a community supported version as soon as possible. Please see our <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/\">versioning policy</a> for more information.</p> <h2>Security Issues</h2> <p>One security vulnerability has been closed by this release:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-16850\">CVE-2018-16850</a>: SQL injection in <code>pg_upgrade</code> and <code>pg_dump</code>, via <code>CREATE TRIGGER ... REFERENCING</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Versions Affected: 10, 11</p> <p>Using a purpose-crafted trigger definition, an attacker can run arbitrary SQL statements with superuser privileges when a superuser runs <code>pg_upgrade</code> on the database or during a pg_dump dump/restore cycle. This attack requires a <code>CREATE</code> privilege on some non-temporary schema or a <code>TRIGGER</code> privilege on a table. This is exploitable in the default PostgreSQL configuration, where all users have <code>CREATE</code> privilege on <code>public</code> schema.</p> <h2>Bug Fixes and Improvements</h2> <p>This update also fixes numerous bugs that were reported in the last several months. Some of these issues affect only version 11, but many affect all supported versions.</p> <p>These releases include fixes that:</p> <ul> <li>Ensure that automatically created child indexes are created in the same tablespace as the parent partitioned index</li> <li>Fix several crashes with triggers</li> <li>Fix problems with applying <code>ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS</code> to a partitioned temporary table</li> <li>Fix how <code>NULL</code> values are handled when using <code>LEFT JOIN</code> with a parallelized hash join</li> <li>Several fixes around using named or defaulted arguments in <code>CALL</code> statements</li> <li>Fix for strict aggregate functions (i.e. aggregates that cannot accept <code>NULL</code> inputs) with ORDER BY columns that enforces the strictness check</li> <li>Fix with <code>CASE</code> statements where an expression was cast to an array type</li> <li>Disable an optimization for updating expression indexes in order to prevent a crash</li> <li>Fix a memory leak that occurred on a specific case of using a SP-GiST index</li> <li>Fix for <code>pg_verify_checksums</code> incorrectly reporting on files that are not expected to have checksums</li> <li>Prevent the PostgreSQL server from starting when <code>wal_level</code> is set to a value that cannot support an existing replication slot</li> <li>Ensure that the server will process already-received NOTIFY and SIGTERM interrupts before waiting for client input</li> <li>Allow PL/Ruby to work with newer versions of PostgreSQL</li> <li>Fix for character-class checks on Windows for Unicode characters above U+FFFF, which affected full-text search as well as <code>contrib/ltree</code> and <code>contrib/pg_trgm</code></li> <li>Fix a case where <code>psql</code> would not report the receipt of a message from a <code>NOTIFY</code> call until after the next command</li> <li>Fix build problems on macOS 10.14 (Mojave)</li> <li>Several build fixes for the Windows platform</li> </ul> <p>This updates also contains tzdata release 2018g for DST law changes in Chile, Fiji, Morocco, and Russia (Volgograd), plus historical corrections for China, Hawaii, Japan, Macau, and North Korea.</p> <h2>PostgreSQL 9.3 is End-of-Life (EOL)</h2> <p>PostgreSQL 9.3 is now end-of-life and will no longer receive any bug or security fixes. We urge users to start planning an upgrade to a later version of PostgreSQL as soon as possible. Please see our <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/\">versioning policy</a> for more information.</p> <h2>Updating</h2> <p>All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or use <code>pg_upgrade</code> in order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and update its binaries.</p> <p>If your system is using <code>pg_stat_statements</code> and you are running a version of PostgreSQL 10 or PostgreSQL 11, we advise that you execute the following command after upgrading:</p> <p><code>ALTER EXTENSION pg_stat_statements UPDATE;</code></p> <p>Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional, post-update steps; please see the release notes for earlier versions for details.</p> <h2>Links</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/download/\">Download</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/release.html\">Release Notes</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/\">Security Page</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/\">Versioning Policy</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/postgresql\">Follow @postgresql on Twitter</a></li> </ul>","published":"2018-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","author":"","link":"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1905/","feed":{"source":"https://www.postgresql.org/news.rss","link":"https://www.postgresql.org/","name":"PostgreSQL news"}},{"title":"Planet KDE Categories","content":"<p>Jings no wonder people find computer programming scary when the most easily accessible lanugage, JavaScript, is also the most messy one.</p> <p>Occationally people would mention to me that the categories on Planet KDE didn&#8217;t work and eventually I looked into it and it mostly worked but also sometimes maybe it didn&#8217;t.&#160; Turns out we were checking for no cookies being set and if not we&#8217;d set some defaults for the categories.&#160; But sometimes the CDN would set a cookie first and ours would not get set at all. This was hard to recreate as it didn&#8217;t happen when working locally of course.&#160; And then our JavaScript had at least three different ways to run the initial-setup code but there&#8217;s no easy way to just read a cookie, madness I tell you.&#160; Anyway it should be fixed now and set categories by default but only if it hasn&#8217;t set some before so you may still have to manually choose which you read.</p> <p>In the Configure Feed menu at the top you can select to read blogs in different languages.&#160; By default it shows only blogs in English, as well as Dot News, Project News and any User blogs who have asked to be added (only two are listed in our config).&#160; You can also show blogs in Chinese (also only 2 listed), Italian (none listed), Polish (one), Portugese (two), Spanish (four but kdeblog by Jose is especially prolific) or French (none).&#160; Work to be done includes working out how to make this apply to the RSS feed.</p><p><a href=\"http://jriddell.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/planetkde.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-898\" height=\"439\" src=\"http://jriddell.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/planetkde.png\" width=\"827\" /></a></p><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F07%2Fplanet-kde-categories%2F&#038;t=Planet%20KDE%20Categories&#038;s=100&#038;p&#091;url&#093;=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F07%2Fplanet-kde-categories%2F&#038;p&#091;images&#093;&#091;0&#093;=http%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F11%2Fplanetkde.png&#038;p&#091;title&#093;=Planet%20KDE%20Categories\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"font-size: 0px;

The group committed to initiating a dialogue aimed at investing more time and resources together to identify ways organizations can collectively work towards the goal of increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of digital solutions for development to reach more people across the globe.</p>\n<p>Executives from several NetHope member organizations joined donors from US and European agencies to discuss broad areas of potential collaboration, including strategies to increase integration; joint methods of promoting greater inclusion; common strategies to drive leveraged investment; and practical methods where they can promote more responsible data policies so that new technologies equally benefit and protect the most vulnerable members of society.</p>\n<p>“Technology continues to advance at an increasing rate but has been slow to reach many in the developing world,” said Kate Wilson, CEO of the Digital Impact Alliance. “Only through strong collaboration and information sharing between all actors in the digital development ecosystem can we ensure anyone, anywhere at any time can access life-enhancing services enabled by digital technology.”</p>\n<p>The four challenge areas discussed by the donor and implementing organizations are reflected in DIAL’s latest report: “<a href=\"https://digitalprinciples.org/resource/donor-organizations-the-principles-for-digital-development-a-landscape-assessment-and-gap-analysis/\">Donor Organizations &amp; the Principles for Digital Development: A Landscape Assessment and Gap Analysis</a>.” The report provides a snapshot of the current capacity within donor organizations and recommendations on how development impact can be improved through the more effective use of technology and digital methodologies, including adoption and practice of the <a href=\"https://digitalprinciples.org/\">Principles for Digital Development.</a></p>\n<p>“The Digital Principles are a cornerstone for development organizations who are using technology to improve outcomes,” said Dr. Dirk Aßmann, Director General of Sectoral Department at GIZ.</p>\n<p>Speaking on behalf of the donor and implementing organizations, Dr. Aßmann shared the pledge made to work more closely together in 2019 to support the recommendations made in the new DIAL report and deliver more value for money working with partners.</p>\n<p>“Digital technology, when used well, is a key tool to more effectively and efficiently deliver better development outcomes,” said Lauren Woodman, CEO of NetHope. “Working together, DIAL and NetHope are committed to a robust, ongoing dialogue with the goal of bringing donors, implementing organizations, and technology providers together in partnership to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###</p>\n<p><strong>About the Digital Impact Alliance</strong></p>\n<p>The Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) aims to realize a more inclusive digital society in emerging markets, in which all women, men and children benefit from life-enhancing, mobile-based digital services.

I had never been in a community, even if sometimes I marginally contributed to some open source projects, mainly in translation or in bug reporting. There were various reasons: my chronic lack of free time, and the fear to be totally unuseful due to the fact that there is so many skilled people inside these projects.</p><p>My first Linux distribution was Red Hat Linux 6, back in 1999. Then Fedora Core, but in the subsequent years I was a so called distro hopper, at least on my laptops. Last year I decided to go back to the origins, and install Fedora again. I was surprised by the clean and ease installation process, compared to the past (and compared to other distros). Looking at the wiki and to other project’s sites, I felt like contributing to the Fedora Project was simple and newcomers were welcome. Then I subscribed to various mailing lists, looking to a place where my little skills could be useful.</p><p>The continuation of the story may appear totally unrelated to Fedora. In fact, in the meanwhile, at work I was involved in a project related to a captive portal for a wifi network, and I needed to send some SMS to foreign phone numbers in order to test the registration page. I’m not an international guy, and I have not friends outside my country (in reality yes, a former colleague that lives in Brazil, but it was unavailable at the time). So, in some messages coming from some Fedora mailing list, at the bottom of the emails of a very active contributor I saw a mobile number. I privately contacted him using Hangout, by telling him my needs. He was so kind that I thought that all the people of the Fedora community might be so collaborative and nice. And in fact I’m still impressed by the commitment of a lot of members in avoiding toxic behavior and how important is to maintain an healthy community.&#8221;</p><cite><a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Alciregi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alessio</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/contributor-stories/issue/6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contributor-stories#6</a></cite></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/faw-2018-day-3-becoming-part-of-fedora-family-because-of-her/\">FAW 2018 Day 3: &#8220;Becoming part of Fedora family because of her!&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org\">Fedora Community Blog</a>.</p>\n","published":"2018-11-07T08:15:07.000Z","author":"Justin W.

This replaced the earlier feed manually curated feeds from identi.ca and twitter which people added but had since died out (in the case of identi.ca) and been blocked (in the case of Twitter).&#160; That embedded Twitter feed used the #KDE tag and while there was the odd off topic or abusive post for the most part it was an interesting way to browse what the people of the internet were saying about us.&#160; However Twitter shut that off a few months ago which you could well argue is what happens with closed proprietary services.</p> <p>We do now have a <a href=\"https://mastodon.technology/@kde\">Mastodon</a> account but my limited knowledge and web searching on the subject doesn&#8217;t give a way to embed a hashtag feed and the critical mass doesn&#8217;t seem to be there yet, and maybe it never will due to the federated-with-permissions model just creating more silos.</p> <p>So now I&#8217;ve added a manually curated Twitter feed back to Planet KDE with KDE people and projects.&#160; This may not give us an insight into what the wider internet community is thinking but it might be an easy way to engage more about KDE people and projects as a community.&#160; Or it might not, I haven&#8217;t decided yet and I&#8217;m happy to take feedback on whether it should stay.</p> <p>In the mean time ping me to be added to the list or subscribe a bug on <a href=\"https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?component=Twitter%20Feed&amp;list_id=1562244&amp;product=Planet%20KDE&amp;resolution=---\">bugs.kde.org</a> to request you or someone you know or or your project be added (or removed).&#160;

Apps.</p> <p><img alt=\"01_blog_overview\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-52876\" height=\"561\" src=\"https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/01_blog_overview.png\" width=\"692\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>FileProvider Content URIs</h2> <p>Starting with Android 7 (SDK 24) you cannot use File URIs anymore to share Files to other Android Apps &#8211; you must use a FileProvider to share Files using a Content URI.</p> <p>To avoid this you could use Target SDK 23 as I did for the first parts of this blog.</p> <p>But starting November 1, 2018 Google requires for updates to Apps or new Apps on Google Play to target Android 8 (Oreo, API level 26) or higher, so there&#8217;s no way to share Files on Android without using a FileProvider.</p> <p>Here&#8217;s the workflow to update your sharing App from File URI to FileProvider with Content URI.</p> <h3>&#160;Android Manifest</h3> <p>As a&#160;first step we have to add some info to <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/ekke/ekkesSHAREexample/blob/master/android/AndroidManifest.xml\">AndroidManifest</a></strong><strong>.xml </strong>:</p> <pre class=\"brush:cpp\">&lt;application ...&gt; &lt;provider android:name=\"android.support.v4.content.FileProvider\" android:authorities=\"org.ekkescorner.examples.sharex.fileprovider\" android:grantUriPermissions=\"true\" android:exported=\"false\"&gt; &lt;meta-data android:name=\"android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS\" android:resource=\"@xml/filepaths\"/&gt; &lt;/provider&gt; &lt;/application&gt; </pre> <p>The Provider needs the com.android.support.v4 Libraries. To include them, please add com.android.support to your <a href=\"https://github.com/ekke/ekkesSHAREexample/blob/master/android/build.gradle\">build.gradle</a>&#160;file:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <pre class=\"brush:cpp\">dependencies{ ... compile'com.android.support:support-v4:25.3.1' } </pre> <p>This will only work if you have installed the Android Support Repository.</p> <p>In your <em>QtCreator Preferences &#8594; Devices &#8594; Android,&#160;</em>you get easy access to Android SDK Manager. Please check that under Extras the Android Support Repository is installed:</p> <p><em><img alt=\"02__sdk_manager_support_lib\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-52877\" height=\"82\" src=\"https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/02__sdk_manager_support_lib.png\" width=\"1118\" /></em></p> <p>In your Android Manifest you see a reference to resources @xml/filepaths. You have to add a new File filepaths.xml under android/res/xml:</p> <p><img alt=\"03_filepaths_xml\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-52878\" height=\"584\" src=\"https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/03_filepaths_xml.png\" width=\"522\" /></p> <p>The content of <a href=\"https://github.com/ekke/ekkesSHAREexample/blob/master/android/res/xml/filepaths.xml\">filepaths.xml</a>:</p> <pre class=\"brush:cpp\">&lt;paths xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"&gt; &lt;files-path name=\"my_shared_files\" path=\"share_example_x_files/\" /&gt; &lt;/paths&gt; </pre> <p>This is the mapping to the folder where Android will find your File to be shared. This Folder is inside your AppData Location. Remember: in blog part 1 we used a shared documents location to provide Files to other apps. Now for Android we don&#8217;t use a shared location but a path inside our AppData location. Starting the app I always check if the folder exists:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <pre class=\"brush:cpp\">#if defined (Q_OS_IOS) QString docLocationRoot = QStandardPaths::standardLocations(QStandardPaths::DocumentsLocation).value(0); #endif #if defined(Q_OS_ANDROID) QString docLocationRoot = QStandardPaths::standardLocations(QStandardPaths::AppDataLocation).value(0); #endif mDocumentsWorkPath = docLocationRoot.append(\"/share_example_x_files\"); if (!QDir(mDocumentsWorkPath).exists()) { // create the QDir }</pre> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Last important part in Android Manifest specifies an <strong>Authority</strong>:</p> <pre class=\"brush:cpp\">android:authorities=\"org.ekkescorner.examples.sharex.fileprovider\"</pre> <p>This name must be unique &#8211; so it&#8217;s a good idea to use your package name and append .fileprovider.</p> <h2>&#160;QShareUtils Java Code</h2> <p>As&#160;a last step you must do some small changes in <a href=\"https://github.com/ekke/ekkesSHAREexample/blob/master/android/src/org/ekkescorner/utils/QShareUtils.java\">QShareUtils.java</a>.</p> <p>Import FileProvider and ShareCompat from android.support:</p> <pre class=\"brush:cpp\">import android.support.v4.content.FileProvider; import android.support.v4.app.ShareCompat; </pre> <p>Reference the Authority as defined in AndroidManifest:</p> <pre class=\"brush:cpp\">private static String AUTHORITY=\"org.ekkescorner.examples.sharex.fileprovider\";</pre> <p>You must also create your Intents in a different way:</p> <pre class=\"brush:cpp\">// the old way: Intent sendIntent = new Intent(); Intent sendIntent = ShareCompat.IntentBuilder.from(QtNative.activity()).getIntent(); </pre> <p>You&#8217;re done <img alt=\"&#55357;&#56898;\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p> <p>As a positive side effect, it&#8217;s now much safer to share Files because they are inside your App Sandbox located and not in public shared Folder.</p> <h2>Overview</h2> <p>Here&#8216;s a short Overview about the Android FileProvider implementation:</p> <p><img alt=\"04_fileprovider_overview\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-52879\" height=\"458\" src=\"https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/04_fileprovider_overview.png\" width=\"816\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Some issues from Sharing Files to other Android Apps</h2> <p><strong>Android: Sharing to Google Fotos App</strong></p> <p>If you try to edit an Image in Google Fotos App using the FileProvider, the Fotos App appears in the list of available Apps, but then reports that the File cannot be edited. Viewing works as before.</p> <p>Only current workaround is to use another Foto Editing App.</p> <h2>Thanks</h2> <p>Thanks again to Thomas K. Fischer @taskfabric for his valuable input on this topic.</p> <h2>Have Fun</h2> <p>In the first part of this blog series, I told you that I needed sharing between Apps on Android and iOS for a DropBox &#8211; like customer App. This App is running very well since some months as inHouse App at customer site, so it&#8217;s not publicly available. But my example App is Open Source and now it&#8216;s a good time to download current Version from <a href=\"https://github.com/ekke/ekkesSHAREexample\">Github</a>, build and run the <strong>Sharing Example App</strong>.</p> <p>This was the last part of this blog series, but stay tuned for some other blogs about &#8222;Qt mobile Apps in the Enterprise&#8220; and &#8222;QML Camera on Android and iOS&#8220;.</p> <p>The post <a href=\"https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/11/06/sharing-files-android-ios-qt-app-part-4/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sharing Files on Android or iOS from or with your Qt App &#8211; Part 4</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://blog.qt.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">Qt Blog</a>.</p>","published":"2018-11-06T17:11:15.000Z","author":"Qt Dev Loop","link":"https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/11/06/sharing-files-android-ios-qt-app-part-4/","feed":{"source":"http://planetKDE.org/rss20.xml","link":"http://planetKDE.org/","name":"Planet KDE"}},{"title":"Qt World Summit 2018 Boston","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-18961 fllt\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/2018-10-29-12.30.44-copy-159x300.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0 15px 0 0;\" width=\"\" />This year&#8217;s North American stop on the Qt World Summit world tour was in Boston, held during the Red Sox&#8217;s World Series win. Most of us were glad to be flying home before celebration parades closed the streets! The Qt community has reason to celebrate too, as there&#8217;s an unprecedented level of adoption and support for our favorite UX framework. If you didn&#8217;t get a chance to attend, you missed the best Qt conference on this continent. We had a whole host of KDABians onsite, running training sessions and delivering great talks alongside all the other excellent content. For those of you who missed it, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; there&#8217;s another opportunity coming up! The next stop on Qt&#8217;s European tour will be with Qt World Summit Berlin December 5-6. Be sure to <a href=\"https://www.qt.io/qtws18/training-day-at-qt-world-summit-berlin-2018\">sign up for one of the training sessions</a> now before they&#8217;re sold out.</p> <p>Meanwhile, let me give you a taste of what the Boston Qt World Summit had to offer.</p> <h3>Strong Community</h3> <p><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-18960 alignright flrt\" height=\"183\" src=\"https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/2018-10-29-12.32.31-1-225x300.jpg\" width=\"137\" />One thing was clear: after 23 years, Qt is still going strong. The Qt Company and the greater Qt community have contributed 29,000 commits and fixed 5000 bugs between Qt 5.6.3 and the current head branch. Very kindly and much appreciated, Lars Knoll, CTO of the Qt Company, recognized KDAB as the largest and longest <a href=\"https://www.kdab.com/kdab-contributions-qt-5-9/\">external contributor</a> to the ever-growing Qt codebase in his opening keynote. All of this effort &#8211; and most of the things discussed in this blog &#8211; come to fruition in Qt 5.12 LTS, with an expected release date at the end of November.</p> <h3>Qt is Everywhere</h3> <div class=\"wp-caption alignleft fllt\" id=\"attachment_18956\" style=\"width: 186px;\"><img alt=\"Training day @ QtWS18\" class=\" wp-image-18956\" height=\"132\" src=\"https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/2018-10-29-11.21.33-300x225.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0 20px 0 0;\" width=\"176\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Training day @ QtWS18</p></div> <p>Another observation is that Qt is everywhere. Lars shared that it has now been downloaded five million times, a huge increase from three and a half million just two years ago. The more than 400 attendees at Qt World Summit Boston came from over 30 industries, representing academia, automotive, bioscience, defense, design, geo imaging, industrial automation, energy and utilities, and plenty more. All the training sessions and the talks were well attended, most to full capacity with eager attendees standing at the back.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Cross-platform Qt</h3> <p>Is there a reason for this upsurge in Qt interest? Multi-platform is now a critical strategy for nearly every product today. Since Qt provides comprehensive support for mobiles, desktops, and embedded, it has become a top choice for broad cross-platform UX development. It&#8217;s not enough to release a cool, innovative product &#8211; if it doesn&#8217;t link to your desktop or provide a mobile-compatible connection, it often can&#8217;t get off the ground.</p> <div class=\"wp-caption alignright fllt\" id=\"attachment_18962\" style=\"width: 189px;\"><img alt=\"Qt for Microcontrollers\" class=\" wp-image-18962\" height=\"134\" src=\"https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/2018-10-29-15.45.00-300x225.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0 20px 0 0;\" width=\"179\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Qt for Microcontrollers</p></div> <p>While there weren&#8217;t too many new platforms announced that Qt doesn&#8217;t already run on, there was invigorated discussion and demoing at the low end of the embedded spectrum. <a href=\"https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/05/03/qt-microncontrollers-mcu/\">Qt on Microcontrollers</a> is a new initiative, trimming Qt down to run on smaller MMU-less chips like the Arm Cortext-M7. While still needing some optimization and trimming to get to the smallest configurations, Qt on Microcontrollers currently takes 3-10MB of RAM and 6-13MB of ROM/Flash, making it an attractive option to create one code base that can address a range of products regardless of form factor.</p> <h3>Broad Offering</h3> <p>Another reason behind Qt&#8217;s increasing prominence is the breadth of the Qt offering. From 3D through design to web, there are many new improvements and components that make Qt a safe choice for teams that need to continually expand their product&#8217;s capabilities. While there have been a host of new additions to the Qt portfolio, here are a few of the more notable ones.</p> <h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Qt 3D Studio</h4> <p>In a programmer&#8217;s worldview, design is often a nice-to-have, yet not a must-have. I guarantee that perspective will change for anyone who had the good fortune of attending Beyond the UX Tipping Point, the keynote from Jared Spool, the so-called Maker of Awesome from Center Centre.</p> <div class=\"wp-caption alignleft fllt\" id=\"attachment_18875\" style=\"width: 301px;\"><a href=\"https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/Kuesa-designers-1.png\"><img alt=\"Kuesa preview\" class=\" wp-image-18875\" height=\"159\" src=\"https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/Kuesa-designers-1-300x164.png\" style=\"margin: 0 20px 0 0;\" width=\"291\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kuesa preview</p></div> <p>If you weren&#8217;t able to attend the conference, I recommend you watch <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/164258612/\">Jared&#8217;s video</a>. Once you do, you&#8217;ll be glad that the Qt Company just released Qt Design Studio to help build great interfaces. KDABian Mike Krus also gave a tantalizing preview of Kuesa, a new KDAB tool architected to marry the worlds of design and development. We&#8217;ve got some info on <a href=\"https://www.kdab.com/kuesa\">our Kuesa webpage</a>&#160;(and a screenshot here) &#8211; keep an eye out for more to come soon.</p> <h4 style=\"clear: both;\">Qt for Python</h4> <p>As an aficionado of the language, I&#8217;ve always found Python seriously missing UX support &#8211; there are solutions but none that are ideal. With the release of Qt for Python however, Python finally has a capable, regularly maintained UI tool with a huge community. This includes integration into the Qt Creator IDE; it will now go from a technical preview to officially supported in <a href=\"https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python\">Qt 5.12 and beyond</a>. I predict that this will soon make Qt the UI framework of choice for Python &#8211; happy news for the many folks who prefer C++ be neatly tucked under the covers.</p> <h4>WebAssembly</h4> <p>There are some clear benefits to running code within a browser recognized by cloud companies &#8211; lightweight (and often no) installation required, access everywhere to centralized, managed, and backed-up data stores, along with immediate and hassle-free updates. Those same benefits have now come to Qt with the support of WebAssembly. This lets you compile your Qt application (and with C++ too, not just QML/Qt Quick, mind you) into a WebAssembly compatible package to be deployed on a web server. This technology is now in tech preview, but it&#8217;s an active project that will be able to expand the reach of Qt into the cloud realm.</p> <h3>Building Bridges</h3> <p><img alt=\"Frances and Ann #color4cancer\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-18955 fllt\" height=\"\" src=\"https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/2018-10-29-10.11.56-300x225.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0 20px 0 0;\" width=\"250\" />Maybe all this flurry of Qt activity is also because it provides a common platform that can build a bridge between disparate disciplines like art, technology, and research. An example of this is&#160;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2AKqIbo\">nanoQuill</a>, a collaboration between KDAB, the Qt Company, a biotech company:&#160;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Ofp7fS\">Quantitative Imaging Systems (Qi)</a>, and Oregon Health &amp; Science University that crowd-sources electron microscope images of cancer cells for people to artfully color, thus&#160;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2AKpsFc\">#color4cancer</a>.</p> <p>Based on Qi&#8217;s vision of merging programming and computer&#160;graphics with microscopy, nanoQuill built&#160;an application to&#160;use&#160;machine learning on these human colored images to discern cell micro structures, which in turn helps us understand how tumour cells develop resistance to escape cancer-targeting drugs.</p> <div class=\"wp-caption alignright fllt\" id=\"attachment_18963\" style=\"width: 260px;\"><img alt=\"Final #color4cancer cell\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-18963 flrt\" height=\"\" src=\"https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/IMG_4974-300x225.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0 20px 0 0;\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Final #color4cancer cell</p></div> <p>Currently, nanoQuill allows anyone to #color4cancer and post their artwork via their&#160;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2ln2ucB\">website gallery</a>,&#160;a coloring book,&#160;<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2Ciujuw\">nanoQuill: The Coloring Book of Life</a>&#160;published in December of 2017, and will soon be in a form of an app. We had a large nanoQuill poster in our booth that people colored throughout the event, allowing Qt World Summit attendees to truthfully say they were not only learning about the latest Qt developments, they were helping fight cancer with art.</p> <h3 style=\"clear: both;\">CNC Craftspeople</h3> <div class=\"wp-caption alignleft fllt\" id=\"attachment_18965\" style=\"width: 310px;\"><img alt=\"Shaper Origin in action\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-18965 flrt\" height=\"175\" src=\"https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-9.31.03-AM-300x175.png\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shaper Origin in action</p></div> <p>Another great merger of art and technology was seen at our KDAB customer showcase from a company called <a href=\"https://www.shapertools.com/\">Shaper Tools</a>. If you think you saw a table full of dominos at the edge of our booth, we weren&#8217;t passing the time playing &#8211; those &#8220;dominos&#8221; were actually optical registration tapes that allowed Shaper&#8217;s hand-held CNC machine to perfectly cut complex shapes. Look at some of the amazing projects that <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iEv2wcOukjQ\">woodworkers have created using the Shaper Origin</a>, and you&#8217;ll see that advanced technology doesn&#8217;t have to replace master craftsmanship &#8211; it can enable it.</p> <h3>Summary</h3> <p>Whether you attended Qt World Summit 2018 to learn about the details of C++ and Qt or the industry trends in medical, automotive, and IoT, there was lots in Boston for everyone.

Most people will start contributing virtually, in IRC, mailing lists, pull requests, or other ways. For me, my journey into the Fedora community began at Flock 2015 in Rochester, NY. Conveniently, the conference was the week before the day I would move to Rochester to begin my first year of academic studies at a university in Rochester. I decided to move up early and attend because I was a Fedora user and thought it would be interesting to be a part of Flock.</p><p>Flock was amazing and I saw how diverse and large the Fedora community was. People from around the world were here to discuss, plan, and move forward this open source project. One of the things that stood out to me was the conference was more than just hard work and professional context (it was these things too) – but at the end of the day, I could see these people were friends with each other too, and I got to know the Fedora community in a more personal way. One example of this I remember was the Fedora Marketing planning session. There were many intense discussions with many disagreements, but delivered constructively. Then, later that evening, I saw a lot of the same people who were debating intensely either eating together or sharing some drinks, talking like friends that had known each other for years.</p><p>At this time, I was not a contributor. I didn&#8217;t know anyone in the conference. I went alone. I moved into Rochester that week coming from Atlanta, Georgia, so it was a new conference and a new city that was my new home, but it didn&#8217;t feel this way to me yet. There was one point when there was a coffee break and no talks were going on. Many people were talking, but I was quietly off to the side by myself. I didn&#8217;t know who he was at the time, but Pete Travis approached me and started a friendly conversation, about who I was, why I decided to come to Flock, and some of my interests.</p><p>We talked about a few things, but I remember nerding out about a crazy idea of how Fedora could better target a younger audience through gaming. At the time, I was a staff member of one of the largest open source Minecraft server software projects. I saw how so many kids and young adults were exposed to open source and became involved with open source because of Minecraft. I forget what the tie-in to Fedora was, but there was a crazy idea of how Fedora could try to grow and attract those kinds of people as users to the distribution.</p><p>I think the idea was a little pie-in-the-sky, but Pete didn&#8217;t criticize it or shoot it down. He talked with me about it and made me feel like I could be onto something if I developed the idea further. But the important part wasn&#8217;t anything about my crazy idea. In that moment, I started to feel less of an outsider. I started to think of things I could bring to this open source community and project. For the first time, I didn&#8217;t think of myself as an observer, but I realized I could be a participant too, if I made the effort to get involved and participate. I doubt Pete even remembers this, but for me, it was somewhere in that moment where I began to feel a part of this huge community I had spent most of the week just watching.</p><p>Even though I haven&#8217;t seen Pete for a while now, his impact on me starting my journey into Fedora was huge. For the last three years, my adventure and time in Fedora has taken me to all kinds of new places and I have had countless new experiences. And yet, somehow in the last three years of everything that I have seen and has happened to me, I can remember this one simple experience that made a big difference to me.&#8221;</p><cite><a href=\"https://blog.justinwflory.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Justin W.

We have been working on what he decided to be most important, mostly chrys fixing issues to make things work with Plasma and screen readers. After getting Orca to read desktop icons he spent quite some time to improve the various start menus.</p> <p>With so much fresh energy around I started poking at KWin, which was a bit scary, to be honest. It was fun to read code I hadn&#8217;t looked at before. In the end, after I spent a while working on a huge work-around, it turned out that we could enable the task switcher to work with relatively little code added. The main issue was that KWin does really not want to give focus to the task switcher. My first attempt was to write sub-classes of <a href=\"https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qaccessibleinterface.html\">QAccessibleInterface</a> for everything in KWin. That started to work, but during some debugging I realized that KWin was actually creating the regular representations for its UI, it was just not properly announcing them to Orca. Thus I threw away my almost complete prototype. At least I verified that it&#8217;s possible to create an entire Qt UI for screen readers only, disconnected from the actual UI. Thanks to <a href=\"https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qaccessible.html#installFactory\">QAccessible::installFactory</a> it is nowadays pretty easy to instantiate custom representations (subclasses of <a href=\"https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qaccessibleinterface.html\">QAccessibleInterface</a>). Once that was done, I started over and made the task switcher think it&#8217;s an active window without letting X11 or Wayland know. That way we get the right dbus messages sent to Orca, when alt-tabbing through the windows. Thanks David, Martin, Roman and Vlad for your input <img alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://blogs.fsfe.org/gladhorn/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" /> </p> <p>More work is needed on Plasma when it comes to keyboard usability &#8211; getting the focus onto the panel and the various notification areas. I&#8217;m sure some great ideas are already being worked on, but I can see this easily as a blocker going forward. Configuring the network, checking the battery status and other tasks are really important after all.</p> <p>I wrote the basics for Kate to work with screen readers in 2014 and it seems like there are some improvements needed when working with Orca, luckily we got some help from Joanie (who maintains Orca) to figure out what goes wrong when navigating by lines.

I found open source intimidating &#8211; and I used to think a thousand times before sending any message on IRC. During those first few days, I used webchat to connect to IRC &#8211; simply because I didn&#8217;t know any other alternative. The internet connection I was using was also not that good and I was worried it would drop off and I would miss a message. I am not sure if I missed any messages but after a few days, Justin reached out and helped me set up my IRC bouncer. I am pretty sure I asked him stupid questions but he didn’t show it and I am glad for that! That act of empathy gave me a new found motivation to contribute to Fedora and I have continued since (even though the bouncer hasn&#8217;t!).&#8221;</p><cite><a href=\"https://bee2502.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Bee Padalkar</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/contributor-stories/issue/2\" target=\"_blank\">contributor-stories#2</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n<h2>The community is what makes the difference</h2>\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/contributor-stories/issue/4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Contributor Story #4</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/x3m\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eduard Lucena</a> (x3mboy)<br></h4>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Who is your story about?</strong>: <a href=\"https://tatica.org/en/about/\" target=\"_blank\">María Leandro</a></li><li><strong>What is their FAS username?</strong>: <a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Tatica\" target=\"_blank\">tatica</a></li></ul>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;It was year 2009 and I move from my native city to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Caracas</a>.<br>I met tatica several years ago, in my college years, when I was trying to promote FLOSS in my university with my LUG and travel across the country with a national congress. She was also the photographer of my wedding.</p><p>At that time (2009) I was working with the Ubuntu Local Community and we were more focused in attend events and some installations. Once at Caracas I met with tatica to help with the organization of the FLISoL and she was the national coordinator. In that FLISoL I was representing Ubuntu and installing Ubuntu and I saw the Fedora stand, they were showing the stuff I usually do in my Ubuntu, but with Fedora, and that let me to think, I can try Fedora again (I knew Fedora Core 3 and 4 before, but I didn&#8217;t found it interesting). After FLISoL, I was a little upset and tire about the Ubuntu Community because I was wanting to do more, more than just events, more than a personal blog, more than just show the distro, but I focused in my job and I started to get away from the community, but still using Linux at a daily basis.</p><p>Getting in touch with people at Caracas and nearby areas, I&#8217;ve attended to a meeting with one of the oldest hardcore communities in Venezuela, I knew several of the guys there, including tatica, in that meeting she invited me to the FUDCon that will be held in Valencia (2012). There I notice something that I never notice before, and it wasn&#8217;t the event or the talks, It was the community itself that took my attention. There I have the chance of talk to several Ambassadors from Latam and to know how their work was actually affecting the distro, not only giving talks, but working in packaging, testing, coding, design, marketing and a lot of areas that actually helps the distro to grow, hand to hand with the community. That year I talked with tatica and told her I want to be part of this and I receive from her an advice that I still carry with me when I&#8217;m going to do something related to the community: &#8220;We are Friends, we have a Free, First and Feature distro to complete our 4 Foundations but the real gasoline that keep this engine going is the commitment. If you want to work with this awesome community be honest, be committed and be humble, that way you will gain trust in the community and things will be great both for you and for Fedora&#8221;. After that year I was going in and out of the community until 2016 when I email her and told I want to be an Ambassador. She IS my mentor, she taught me how this wheel rolls and she still give me advices in times of despair. For that and more, my contributor story is about her.

This has several implications.&#160;Targeting Oreo comes with an updated Support Library, which forces us to drop support for Android 4.0 and below. According to our Google Play data this will affect approximately 400 users. We are very sorry about that, but these users won&#8217;t receive further updates. Furthermore, Android Oreo introduced some restrictions in regard to apps running in the background. In the future in order to be able to run in the background KDE Connect needs to show a persistent notification. The good news is that you can hide the notification. The (slightly) bad news is that we cannot do it by default. To hide the notification you need to long-press it and switch it off. Other notifications from KDE Connect are unaffected by this.</p> <h2>1.10 Changes</h2> <p>These are the main changes of version 1.10. Not mentioned are countless small improvements and under-the-hood changes.</p> <p>Mouse input now works with the same speed independent from the phones pixel density.</p> <p>The media controller now allows stopping playback.</p> <p>Run command supports triggering commands using kdeconnect:// URLs. Useful for integration with NFC tags and 3rd-party apps.</p> <p>The notification filter allows quickly (de-)selecting all apps.</p> <p>Several settings scatterd across the UI have been bundled into a single settings screen.</p> <p>A lot of work has gone into how we handle SMS on the Android side in preparation for something huge. Stay tuned <img alt=\"&#55357;&#56841;\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p> <h2>Other changes</h2> <p>The desktop side has improved as well since my last post.</p> <p>The windows build of KDE Connect gained support for keyboard input.</p> <p>The plasmoid gained a couple of additions. In my last update I mentioned that it is possible to run commands from there. It is now also possible to lauch the command setup from there. Furthermore it is now possible to select files to share them from there.</p> <p>The Linux Mobile App gained many visual improvements and features. It now supports sharing files and controlling the system volume.</p> <p>If you are using&#160;<a href=\"https://volkerkrause.eu/2018/08/19/kde-itinerary-introduction.html\">Itinerary</a>&#160;you can send booking information from the PC directly to the phone via KDE Connect.</p> <p>It is now possible to send files directly from Pantheon Files (and other Elementary apps) and Thunar via KDE Connect.</p> <p>Again, there are countless other improvements that I did not explicitly mention.</p> <p>A big thanks to all people who contributed to this!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","published":"2018-11-04T22:14:13.000Z","author":"Nicolas Fella (nicofee)","link":"https://nicolasfella.wordpress.com/2018/11/04/kde-connect-new-stuff-0x3/","feed":{"source":"http://planetKDE.org/rss20.xml","link":"http://planetKDE.org/","name":"Planet KDE"}},{"title":"KMyMoney 5.0.2 released","content":"<p>The KMyMoney development team is proud to present <a href=\"http://download.kde.org/stable/kmymoney/5.0.2/src/kmymoney-5.0.2.tar.xz.mirrorlist\">version 5.0.2</a> of its open source Personal Finance Manager.</p> <p>Although several members of the development team had been using version 5.0.1 in production for some time, a number of bugs and regressions slipped through testing, mainly in areas and features not used by them.</p> <p>These have been reported by many of you and the development team worked hard to fix them in the meantime.

As part of the upcoming release we add the <strong>support for JSON file and for ngspice raw file format</strong> which we want to introduce in this short blog post.</p> <p>After the selection of a <strong>JSON</strong> file in the &#8220;Import File&#8221; dialog, its content is shown in a tree view in a manner that many user will be familiar with from other JSON viewers. The relevant parts in a such a JSON file that one usually wants to visualize are arrays and objects. Once the root element that needs to be imported is selected, LabPlot automatically recognizes its type and the type of its children and generates a two dimensional preview of the data to be imported. This works the same for arrays</p> <p><center><a href=\"https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_array.png\" title=\"\"><br /> <img alt=\"JSON array\" src=\"https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_array.png\" width=\"40%\" /></a> <a href=\"https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_array_preview.png\" title=\"\"><img alt=\"Preview of JSON array\" src=\"https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_array_preview.png\" width=\"40%\" /></a><br /> </center></p> <p>as well as for JSON objects<br /> <center><a href=\"https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_object.png\" title=\"\"><br /> <img alt=\"JSON object\" src=\"https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_object.png\" width=\"40%\" /></a> <a href=\"https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_object_preview.png\" title=\"\"><img alt=\"Preview of JSON object\" src=\"https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_object_preview.png\" width=\"40%\" /></a><br /> </center></p> <p>After such a local file was imported, the plotting of data can be done as usual. The part that is of more practical interest, namely the import of data from online web services like stock prices, weather data, data monitoring services, etc., still needs to be implemented. Such services usually exchange the data in JSON format and the features described above can be considered as the preparational steps also in this direction. This is something for the near future.</p> <p><br /> In the previous release we made the support for live data available. To demonstrate this feature we used an <a href=\"https://labplot.kde.org/2018/05/16/support-for-live-data/\" title=\"\">example</a> based on the results of calculations done in <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/gnucap/gnucap.html\" title=\"\">Gnucap</a> &#8211; an open-source circuit simulator. The Gnucap simulation was controlled by a small PyQt GUI and the results where written out to an ASCII file which was then consumed by LabPlot (import of live data and its visualization). To further support this community, we decided to add the support for <strong>native raw format of ngspice</strong> &#8211; <a href=\"http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/\" title=\"\">another open-source application for circuit analysis</a>. We read both flavors of it &#8211; binary and ASCII. When opening such a file, LabPlot auto-detects the ngspice raw format and selects the proper import filter.</p> <p>To demonstrate this, we use a simple circuit consisting of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFET\" title=\"\">junction gate field-effect transistor</a> and of two variable voltages &#8211; gate-source and drain-source:<center><br /> <a href=\"https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/circuit.png\" title=\"\"><br /> <img alt=\"Circuit\" src=\"https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/circuit.png\" width=\"50%\" /><br /> </a><br /> </center></p> <p>The behavior of such a transistor is usually studied with the help of its &#8220;characteristic curves&#8221; &#8211; the transfer characteristic showing the current as the function of the gain-source voltage and the output characteristic showing the current as the function of the drain-source voltage. This time the calculation is done with ngspice and we read the produced raw files with the new import filter: <center><br /> <a href=\"https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/transistor_characteristic_curves.png\" title=\"\"><br /> <img alt=\"Transistor Characteristic Curves\" src=\"https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/transistor_characteristic_curves.png\" width=\"100%\" /><br /> </a><br /> </center></p> <p>To generate the second plot where a family of I<sub>d</sub> curves is calculated for different values of V<sub>gs</sub>, we had to implement a new feature in LabPlot to allow to only connect points that are monotonically increasing. Since all the curves in this family are put into the same data set, without this options the end points of the lines would have been connected with the origin which is not what the user wants to see for this specific data set.</p> <p>The idea for this example and the technical input around ngspice was contributed by Orestes Mas from the Technical University of Catalonia.</p>","published":"2018-11-03T21:25:51.000Z","author":"Alexander Semke","link":"https://labplot.kde.org/2018/11/03/import-of-json-ngspice/","feed":{"source":"http://planetKDE.org/rss20.xml","link":"http://planetKDE.org/","name":"Planet KDE"}},{"title":"Abinash Senapati: Smart Apertium","content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07JFPT9NR/ref=syps?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539593875&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=smart+apertium\"><img alt=\"Smart Apertium\" src=\"https://techievena.github.io/img/post_images/smart_apertium.jpg\" /></a></p>","published":"2018-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","author":"","link":"https://techievena.github.io/alexa/2018/11/03/smart-apertium.html","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute","content":"[object Object]","published":"2018-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Tom Kazimiers","link":"http://postgis.net/2018/11/03/howard_hughes","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Outreachy proposal:","content":"<img src='https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/023/444/original/Screenshot_20180204-101546_2.png' alt='PublicLab'> <br />","published":"2018-11-02T20:40:38.000Z","author":"faithngetich188","link":"https://publiclab.org/notes/faithngetich188/11-02-2018/outreachy-proposal","feed":{"source":"https://publiclab.org/feed.rss","link":"https://publiclab.org/feed.rss","name":"Recent research notes on PublicLab.org"}},{"title":"FPgM report: 2018-44","content":"<img width=\"766\" height=\"324\" src=\"https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fpgm-report-766x324.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Fedora Program Manager weekly report on Fedora Project development and progress\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fpgm-report-766x324.jpg 766w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fpgm-report-300x127.jpg 300w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fpgm-report-768x325.jpg 768w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fpgm-report-1024x433.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /><p>Here&#8217;s your report of what has happened in Fedora Program Management this week.

Meanwhile RHEL did use Plasma 4 and hired a number of developers to help us in our time of need which was fabulous but all except one have left some time ago and nobody expected it to continue for long.</p> <p>So the deprecation is not really new or news and being picked up by the news is poor timing for Red Hat, it&#8217;s unclear if they want some distraction from the IBM news or just The Register playing around.&#160; The community has always been much better at supporting out software for their users, maybe now the community run EPEL archive can include modern Plasma 5 instead of being stuck on the much poorer previous release.</p> <p>Plasma 5 is now lightweight and feature full.&#160; We get new users and people rediscovering us every day who report it as the most usable and pleasant way to run their day.&#160; From my recent trip in Barcelona I can see how a range of different users from university to schools to government consider Plasma 5 the best way to support a large user base.&#160; We now ship on high end devices such as the KDE Slimbook down to the low spec value device of Pinebook.&#160; Our software leads the field in many areas such as video editor Kdenlive, or painting app Krita or educational suite GCompris.&#160; Our range of projects is wider than ever before with textbook project WikiToLearn allowing new ways to learn and we ship our own software through KDE Windows, Flatpak builds and KDE neon with Debs, Snaps and Docker images.</p> <p>It is a pity that RHEL users won&#8217;t be there to enjoy it by default. But, then again, they never really were. KDE is collaborative, open, privacy aware and with a vast scope of interesting projects after 22 years we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible and fun.</p> <a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F02%2Fred-hat-and-kde%2F&#038;t=Red%20Hat%20and%20KDE&#038;s=100&#038;p&#091;url&#093;=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F02%2Fred-hat-and-kde%2F&#038;p&#091;images&#093;&#091;0&#093;=&#038;p&#091;title&#093;=Red%20Hat%20and%20KDE\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"font-size: 0px; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><img alt=\"Facebook\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-share\" height=\"48\" src=\"https://jriddell.org/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/96x96/facebook.png\" style=\"display: inline; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none;\" title=\"Share on Facebook\" width=\"48\" /></a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-twitter nolightbox\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F02%2Fred-hat-and-kde%2F&#038;text=Jonathan%20Riddell%27s%20Diary\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"font-size: 0px; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><img alt=\"twitter\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-share\" height=\"48\" src=\"https://jriddell.org/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/96x96/twitter.png\" style=\"display: inline; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none;\" title=\"Share on Twitter\" width=\"48\" /></a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-google_plus nolightbox\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F02%2Fred-hat-and-kde%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"font-size: 0px; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share on Google+\"><img alt=\"google_plus\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-share\" height=\"48\" src=\"https://jriddell.org/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/96x96/google_plus.png\" style=\"display: inline; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none;\" title=\"Share on Google+\" width=\"48\" /></a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-linkedin nolightbox\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F02%2Fred-hat-and-kde%2F&#038;title=Red%20Hat%20and%20KDE\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"font-size: 0px; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 5px;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share on Linkedin\"><img alt=\"linkedin\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-share\" height=\"48\" src=\"https://jriddell.org/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/96x96/linkedin.png\" style=\"display: inline; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none;\" title=\"Share on Linkedin\" width=\"48\" /></a><a class=\"synved-social-credit\" href=\"http://synved.com/wordpress-social-media-feather/\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"color: #444; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8px; margin-left: 5px; vertical-align: 10px; white-space: nowrap;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WordPress Social Media Feather\"><span>by </span><img alt=\"feather\" height=\"16\" src=\"https://jriddell.org/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/icon.png\" style=\"display: inline; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 16px; height: 16px;\" width=\"16\" /></a>","published":"2018-11-02T16:36:04.000Z","author":"Jonathan Riddell (riddell)","link":"https://jriddell.org/2018/11/02/red-hat-and-kde/","feed":{"source":"http://planetKDE.org/rss20.xml","link":"http://planetKDE.org/","name":"Planet KDE"}},{"title":"Maps in Augmented Reality with JavaScript","content":"","published":"2018-11-02T11:00:00.000Z","author":"Petr Sloup","link":"https://www.maptiler.com/blog/2018/11/maps-in-augmented-reality-with-javascript.html","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"MusicBrainz introducing: Genres!","content":"<p>One of the things various people have asked MusicBrainz for time and time again has been genres. However, genres are <em>hard</em> to do right and they&#8217;re very much subjective—with MusicBrainz dealing almost exclusively with objective data. It&#8217;s been a recurring discussion on almost all of <a href=\"https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/MusicBrainz_Summit\">our summits</a>, but a couple years ago (with some help from our friend Alastair Porter and his research colleagues at <a href=\"https://www.upf.edu/\">UPF</a>), we finally came to a path forward—and recently Nicolás Tamargo (reosarevok) finally turned that path forward into code… which has now been released! You can see it in action on e.g., <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e\">Nine Inch Nails’ Year Zero release group</a>.</p>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>For now genres are <em>exactly the same as <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Folksonomy_Tagging\">(folksonomy) tags</a></em> behind the scenes; some tags simply have become the chosen ones and are listed and presented as genres. The list of which tags are considered as genres is currently <a href=\"https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server/blob/master/entities.json#L666\">hardcoded</a>, and no doubt it is missing a lot of our users&#8217; favourite genres. We plan to expand the genre list based on your requests, so if you find a genre that is missing from it, request it by <a href=\"https://tickets.metabrainz.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10032&amp;issuetype=2&amp;summary=Enter%20the%20genre%20name%20here!\">adding a style ticket</a> with the &#8220;Genres&#8221; component.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned above, genres are very subjective, so just like with folksonomy tags, you can upvote and downvote genres you agree or disagree with on any given entity, and you can also submit genre(s) for the entity that no one has added yet.</p>\n<h3>What about the API?</h3>\n<p>A bunch of the people asking for genres in MusicBrainz have been <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Enabled_Applications\">application developers</a>, and this type of people are usually more interested in how to actually extract the genres from our data.</p>\n<p>The method to request genres mirrors that of tags: you can use <code>inc=genres</code> to get all the genres everyone has proposed for the entity, or <code>inc=user-genres</code> to get all the genres you have proposed yourself (or both!). For the same release group as before, you&#8217;d want <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres\"><code>https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres</code></a> for the XML API and <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres&amp;fmt=json\"><code>https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres&amp;fmt=json</code></a> for the JSON API.</p>\n<p>Since genres are tags, all the genres will continue to be served with <code>inc=tags</code> as before as well. As such, you can always use the tag endpoint if you would rather filter the tags by your own genre list rather than follow the MusicBrainz one, or if you want to also get other non-genre tags (maybe you want moods, or maybe you&#8217;re really interested in finding artists who perform hip hop music <strong>and</strong> <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/tag/death%20by%20murder\">were murdered</a> – we won&#8217;t stop you!).</p>\n<h4>I use the database directly, not the API</h4>\n<p>You can parse the <code>tag</code>→<code>genres</code> from <a href=\"https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server/raw/master/entities.json\"><code>entities.json</code> in the root of the &#8220;musicbrainz-server&#8221; repository</a> which will give you a list of what we currently consider genres. Then you can simply compare any folksonomy tags from the <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Schema#tag_table.2C_.26_the_.2A_tag_and_tag_raw_tables\"><code>%_tag</code> tables</a>.</p>\n<h4>Note about licensing</h4>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind for any data consumers out there is that, as per our <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/doc/About/Data_License\">data licensing</a>, tags—and thus also genres—are not part of our &#8220;core (CC0-licensed) data&#8221;, but rather part of our &#8220;supplementary data&#8221; which is available under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike-<strong>NonCommercial</strong> license</a>. Thus, if you wish to use our genre data for something commercial, you should get a commercial use license from the <a href=\"https://metabrainz.org/\">MetaBrainz Foundation</a>. (Of course, if you&#8217;re going to provide a commercial product using data from MusicBrainz, you should always sign up as a <a href=\"https://metabrainz.org/supporters\">supporter</a> regardless. :)).</p>\n<h3>The future?</h3>\n<p>We are hoping to get a better coverage of genres (especially genres outside of the Western tradition, of which we have a very small amount right now) with your help! That applies both to expanding the genre list and actually applying genres to entities. For the latter, remember that everyone can downvote your genre suggestion if they don&#8217;t agree, so don&#8217;t think too much about &#8220;what genres does the world think apply to this artist/release/whatever&#8221;. Just add what <strong>you</strong> feel is right; if everyone does that we&#8217;ll get much better information. <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>In the near future we&#8217;re hoping to move the genre list from the code to the database (which shouldn&#8217;t mean too much for most of you, other than less waiting between a new genre being proposed for the list and it being added, but is much better for future development). Also planned is a way to indicate that several tags are the same genre (so that if you tag something as &#8220;hiphop&#8221;, &#8220;hip hop&#8221; or &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; the system will understand that&#8217;s really all the same). Further down the line, who knows! We might eventually make genres into limited entities of a sort, in order to allow linking to, say, the appropriate Wikidata/Wikipedia pages. We might do some fun stuff. Time will tell!</p>\n","published":"2018-11-02T10:00:24.000Z","author":"Freso","link":"https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2018/11/02/musicbrainz-introducing-genres/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.musicbrainz.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.musicbrainz.org","name":"MusicBrainz/MetaBrainz Blog"}},{"title":"KDE Frameworks 5 for Yocto","content":"<p>At the KDE booth at <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/elc-openiot-europe-2018/\">Embedded Linux Conference Europe</a> in Edinburgh the other week you might have seen the Plasma Mobile shell running on a Raspberry Pi 3, similar to what I <a href=\"https://conf.kde.org/en/Akademy2018/public/events/23\">presented at Akademy</a> in Vienna. Besides showing the flexibility of Plasma and how nicely the <a href=\"https://www.plasma-mobile.org/\">Plasma Mobile</a> shell works on touch screens, this was originally built as a demonstration of the <a href=\"https://api.kde.org/frameworks/index.html\">KDE Frameworks 5</a> <a href=\"https://www.yoctoproject.org/\">Yocto</a> recipes.</p> <h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3> <p>Making KF5 easily available to users of Yocto is actually a rather old idea, and considering how popular Qt and Yocto are for user interfaces in embedded systems that makes a lot of sense. Johan Thelin <a href=\"https://www.thelins.se/johan/blog/2014/07/kf5-in-yocto/\">started the work on this</a> in 2014. Things went dormant for a while until this was revived during <a href=\"https://akademy.kde.org/2017\">Akademy in Almer&#237;a</a> last year. By now we have 74 of the 79 KF5 frameworks available in the <a href=\"https://phabricator.kde.org/source/yocto-meta-kf5/\">meta-kf5</a> layer.</p> <p>With the KDE Frameworks being mostly libraries, it&#8217;s somewhat hard to test and demonstrate their capabilities though. So, we added another Yocto layer, <a href=\"https://phabricator.kde.org/source/yocto-meta-kde/\">meta-kde</a>, which contains recipes for the Plasma parts needed for bringing up a basic Plasma Mobile shell.</p> <h3 id=\"status\">Status</h3> <p>With the monthly release cycle of KF5, sustainable maintenance has been a key focus. Besides automating the recipe updates as much as possible, getting rid of all patches against KF5 has been a priority. With 5.48.0 we finally achieved that, the KF5 Yocto recipes now use entirely unpatched upstream code. That might seem somewhat obvious, but is far from common in the Yocto world unfortunately.</p> <p>A frequent reason for needing patches (and also the reason for the majority of KF5 patches resulting from this) is fixing cross-compilation issues. While cross-compilation works reasonably well out of the box for simple libraries, things get a bit more interesting when custom code generation tools get involved (example fixes: <a href=\"https://phabricator.kde.org/D7102\">syntax-highlighting</a>, <a href=\"https://phabricator.kde.org/D6990\">Sonnet</a>).</p> <p>The Yocto build however is now continuously verifying that cross-compilation works for KF5, which other platforms needing this benefit from as well, like Android.</p> <h3 id=\"outlook\">Outlook</h3> <p>There is more to do of course, as the <a href=\"https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/241/\">Phabricator workboard</a> shows. This is an interesting playground if you want to understand, explore and tweak every little detail of a Linux-based system, e.g. for minimizing boot time or image size of a Plasma Mobile system.</p> <p>In case you just want to try Plasma Mobile or do application development for it, there are probably easier ways forward though, Yocto is known to have a rather steep learning curve, which is the price you pay for its flexibility.</p> <p>If you are interested in KF5 on Yocto or have questions about this, join us on the <a href=\"https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-embedded\">kde-embedded mailing list</a>.</p>","published":"2018-11-02T06:45:00.000Z","author":"Volker Krause","link":"https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2018/11/02/kf5-for-yocto.html","feed":{"source":"http://planetKDE.org/rss20.xml","link":"http://planetKDE.org/","name":"Planet KDE"}},{"title":"Vanguard Appraisals","content":"[object Object]","published":"2018-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Andy Colson","link":"http://postgis.net/2018/11/02/vanguard_appraisals","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Server update, 2018-11-01","content":"<p>This release includes a first implementation of genres &#8211; expect more information as a blog post in the following days.

I took part as a Plasma/KWin developer. My main goal was to simply get into contact with developers from other projects and companies working on open source technology in order to show them that the KDE community aims at being a reliable partner to them now and in the future.</p> <p>Instead of recounting chronologically what went down at the conference let us look at three key groups of attendees, who are relevant to KWin and Plasma: the graphics drivers and kernel developers, upstream userland and colleagues working on other compositor projects.</p> <h3 id=\"graphics-drivers-and-kernel\">Graphics drivers and kernel</h3> <p>If you search on Youtube for videos of talks from previous XDC conferences or for the videos from this year&#8217;s XDC you will notice that there are many talks by graphics drivers developers, often directly employed by hardware vendors.</p> <p>The reason is that hardware vendors have enough money to employ open source developers and send them to conferences and that they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2XHZd4uXRI&amp;t=16m20s\">benefit greatly</a> from contributing directly to open source projects. Something which also Nvidia management will realize at some point.</p> <p>On the other side I talked to the Nvidia engineers at the conference, who were very friendly and eager to converse about their technical solutions which they are allowed to share with the community. Sadly their primarily usage of proprietary technology in general hinders them in taking a more active role in the community and there is apparently no progress on their proposed open standard Wayland buffer sharing API.</p> <p>At least we arranged that they would send some hardware for testing purposes. I won&#8217;t be the recipient, since my work focus will be on other topics in the immediate future, but I was able to point to another KWin contributor, who should receive some Nvidia hardware in the future so he can better troubleshoot problems our users on Nvidia experience.</p> <p>The situation looks completely different for Intel and AMD. In particular Intel has a longstanding track record of open development of their own drivers and contributing to generic open source solutions also being supported by other vendors. And AMD decided not too long ago to open source their most commonly used graphics drivers on Linux. In both cases it is a bliss to target their latest hardware and it was as great as I imagined it to be talking to their developers at XDC, because they are not only interested in their own products but in boosting the whole ecosystem and finding suitable solutions for everyone. I want to explicitly mention Martin Peres from Intel and Harry Wentland from AMD, who I had long, interesting discussions with and who showed great interest in improving the collaboration of low-level engineers and us in userland.</p> <p>Who I haven&#8217;t mentioned yet is ARM. Although they are just like Nvidia, Intel and AMD an XDC &#8220;Gold Sponsor&#8221; their contribution in terms of content to the conference was minimal, most likely for the same reason of being mostly closed source as in the Nvidia case. And that is equally sad, since we do have some interest in making ARM a well supported target for Plasma. An example is Plasma on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thepine64/status/1057379204021583872\">Pinebook</a>. But the driver situation for ARM Mali GPUs is just ugly, developing for them is torture. I know because I did some of the integration work for the Pinebook. All the more I respect the efforts by several extremely talented hackers to provide open-source drivers for ARM Mali GPUs. Some of them <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtt2Y7XZS3k\">presented</a> their work at XDC.</p> <h3 id=\"xorg-and-freedesktoporg-upstream\">X.Org and freedesktop.org upstream</h3> <p>Linux graphics drivers are cool and all, but without XServer, Wayland and other auxiliary cross-vendor user space libraries there would be not much to show off to the user. And after all it is the <em>X.Org</em> Developer&#8217;s conference, most notably being home to the XServer and maybe in the future <a href=\"https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2018-October/039533.html\">governance wise</a> also to freedesktop.org. So after looking at low-level driver development, what role did these projects and their developers play at the conference?</p> <p>First I have to say, that the dichotomy established in the previous paragraph is of course not that distinct. Several graphics drivers are part of mesa, which is again part of freedesktop.org and many graphics drivers developers are also contributing to user land or involved in organizational aspects of X.Org and freedesktop.org. A more prominent one of these organizational aspects is hosting of projects. There was a presentation by Daniel Stone about the freedesktop.org transition to GitLab, what was a rather huge project this year and is still ongoing.</p> <p>But regarding technical topics there were not many presentations about XServer, Wayland and other high level components. After seeing some lightning talks on the first day of the conference I decided to hold a lightning talk myself about my Xwayland GSOC project in 2017. I got one of the last slots on Friday and you can watch a video of my presentation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjs_Yoz5n_c\">here</a>. Also Drew De Vault presented a demo of wlroot&#8217;s layer shell.</p> <p>So there were not so many talks about the higher level user space graphics stack, but some of us plan to increase the ratio of such talks in the future. After talking about graphics drivers developers and upstream userland this brings me directly to the last group of people:</p> <h3 id=\"compositors-developers\">Compositors developers</h3> <p>We were somewhat a special crowd at XDC. From distinct projects, some of us were from wlroots, Guido from Purism and me from KWin, we were united in, to my knowledge, all of us being the first time at XDC.</p> <p>If you look at past conferences the involvement of compositor developers was marginal. My proclaimed goal and I believe also the one of all the others is to change this from now on. Because from embedded to desktop we will all benefit by working together where possible and exchanging information with each other, with upstream and with hardware vendors. I believe X.Org and freedesktop.org can be a perfect platform for that.</p> <h3 id=\"final-remarks-on-organisation\">Final remarks on organisation</h3> <p>The organisation of the conference was simply great. Huge thanks to igalia for hosting XDC in their beautiful home town.</p> <p>What I really liked about the conference schedule was that there were always three long breaks every day and long pauses between the talks allowing the attendees to talk to each other.</p> <p>What I didn&#8217;t like about the conference was that all the attendees were spread over the city in different hotels. I do like the KDE Akademy approach better in this regard: everyone in one place so you can drink together a last beer at the hotel bar before going to bed. That said there were events at multiple evenings throughout the week, but recommending a reasonable priced default hotel for everyone not being part of a large group might still be an idea for next XDC.</p>","published":"2018-10-31T11:00:00.000Z","author":"Roman Gilg","link":"http://www.subdiff.de/2018/10/31/representing-kde-at-xdc-2018/","feed":{"source":"http://planetKDE.org/rss20.xml","link":"http://planetKDE.org/","name":"Planet KDE"}},{"title":"Pgpool-II 4.0.1, 3.7.6, 3.6.13, 3.5.17 and 3.4.20 are now officially released.","content":"<h3>What is Pgpool-II?</h3> <p>Pgpool-II is a tool to add useful features to PostgreSQL, including:</p> <ul> <li>connection pooling</li> <li>load balancing</li> <li>automatic fail over and more.</li> </ul> <h3>Minor releases</h3> <p>Pgpool Global Development Group is pleased to announce the availability of following versions of Pgpool-II:</p> <ul> <li>4.0.1</li> <li>3.7.6</li> <li>3.6.13</li> <li>3.5.17</li> <li>3.4.20</li> </ul> <p>Release notes for versions prior 3.6 are no longer included in the source code. </p> <p>Please take a look at <a href=\"http://www.pgpool.net/docs/latest/en/html/release.html\">release notes</a>.</p> <p>You can download <a href=\"http://pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Downloads\">the source code and RPMs</a>.</p>","published":"2018-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","author":"","link":"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1903/","feed":{"source":"https://www.postgresql.org/news.rss","link":"https://www.postgresql.org/","name":"PostgreSQL news"}},{"title":"digiKam 6.0.0 beta 2 is released","content":"<p>Dear digiKam fans and users, following the first beta release published in September, we are proud to announce the second beta of digiKam 6.0.0.

Anybody who is wondering why is invited to look into Samba history &amp; development, which should be a good enough indication of the problems we&#8217;re dealing with here. This mostly impacted NTLM authentication, which had to be patched in KIO in order to work properly (NTLM version 2).</p> <h2>OAuth2</h2> <p>With the move to the cloud and introduction of Office 365 Microsoft went into more modern authentication methods. One of them is OAuth2, which was already widely used in other services, such as GMail.</p> <p>One specific thing about OAuth2 is that you need to register an application, for which authentication is taking place. In case of Office 365 this means an Azure account is needed to register an application.</p> <p>Evolution, which has been supporting OAuth2 chose to let the user to provide its own registered application, which effectively means that the OAuth2 authentication backend is non-functional out-of-the-box. User interaction is needed in order to enable it.</p> <p>For Akonadi EWS I chose to register my own app, which means that OAuth2 should be working without any further user actions beside supplying a password.</p> <p>The application registration should be working for everyone as it was registered as a global app. It is however possible that an administrator of a corporate Office 365 account may either explicitly block it or use a whitelist of apps that have access to Exchange. Should this ever happen a back door is left behind in the EWS Resource &#8211; similar to Evolution it is possible to configure a different app identifier to be used instead of the default. This can be done by manually editing the <strong>~/.config/akonadi_ews_resource_?rc</strong>&#160;file (? will be a number starting from 0) and adding a new line:</p> <pre>OAuth2AppId=&lt;app-uuid&gt;</pre> <p>In case of very stubborn admins, the ultimate way to work around obstacles is to use the app id from Microsoft Outlook (d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c).</p> <h2>Strong authentication</h2> <p>Experienced sysadmins have already noticed that using just a username and password for authentication is proving to be not sufficient. For that purpose additional authentication steps, such as MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) have been deployed.</p> <p>Another option is to establish some form of trust against the device that is used for authentication, which ensures that access from a company owned or managed device is considered safe.</p> <p>For the latter purpose Microsoft defined an additional authentication protocol called Public Key Authentication Protocol&#160;(PKey) described in <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt223996.aspx\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">[MS-PKAP]</a>. It is used during OAuth2 authentication to prove possession of a device-specific private key. This key is being generated and registered with the Azure Directory during device enrolment into the corporate directory. This can be done by performing a Workplace Join from Windows 10 or using the InTune app on Android.</p> <p>From what I can find it looks like Akonadi EWS is the first open-source implementation of the PKey authentication protocol.</p> <p>Why is this so important? Depending on the security policy defined by the corporate administrator it may have decided to block access to Office 365 from outside the company network for unregistered devices or alternatively require additional authentication steps (MFA) when connecting from outside the office. By setting up Private key authentication it is possible to be seen as trusted in the same way as Windows users.</p> <p>So far there are no open-source tools to register such a certificate/private key with the Azure Directory. Fortunately however the protocol has been published and I will be working on such a tool/script.</p> <p>Both OAuth2 and Public/Private Key Authentication are implemented and will hopefully be part of KDE Applications 18.12 release.</p> <h2>What&#8217;s next on the table</h2> <h3>SAML</h3> <p>I&#8217;m not done with authentication yet. There is one more authentication goodie in the pipeline.</p> <p>While OAuth2 is a nice and generic solution it brings a slight drawback &#8211; you need to type your password and/or MFA token every two weeks or so.</p> <p>For Office 365 and Azure Directory users there is however another way in &#8211; based on ADFS SAML authentication. This method is non-interactive and can be used with just the username/email and password. There is a catch however &#8211; if the administrator has chosen to require strong authentication when connecting outside of trusted network this method will not work unless it is used together with PKey authentication.</p> <h3>EWS SOAP API refactoring</h3> <p>In the current implementation all EWS SOAP requests have been written manually.

GNI is a channel for collective action, advocating to governments and international institutions for policies and laws which promote free expression and privacy. As an observer to GNI, the Wikimedia Foundation will be able to benefit from this accomplished network of human rights defenders, and apply the insights we gain to our existing worldwide efforts to advance these two fundamental rights.</p>\n<p>Principle to the Wikimedia movement is the idea of collaboration. Our projects are continually expanded and improved by a global community of volunteers, and we rely on donations from millions of people worldwide to continue operating year after year. Thus, when the opportunity arose to join GNI and collaborate with other leaders in both technology and digital rights, it was only natural for the Wikimedia Foundation to engage. Everyone who joins GNI, from large technology companies to civil society groups fighting for human rights online, has indicated their commitment to addressing and solving the most prescient issues in <a href=\"https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/policy-issues/\">GNI’s focus areas</a>. By working with other member organizations and companies to further the rights of internet users worldwide, our participation as an observer in GNI will be just one of many ways we give back to the global community who supports the Wikimedia movement.</p>\n<p>The Wikimedia Foundation understands that the protection and <a href=\"https://policy.wikimedia.org/\">promotion of human rights online</a> is essential to what we do. In order to provide access to knowledge for everyone, we must protect freedom of expression on our projects. In practice, this means we work to keep Wikipedia volunteers free from attempts to <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/05/22/a-letter-to-minister-ahmet-arslan/\">block</a> or censor their writing on Wikipedia or requests to <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/07/20/wikimedia-releases-ninth-transparency-report/\">remove their content</a>. We hope that by participating in GNI, we can share our experiences not only as a large internet platform, but as a mission-driven organization that holds our values firm even in the face of threats. In return, we are sure that the insights we will gain from the combined experience of GNI’s members will help us to better our initiatives to promote free expression for our communities.</p>\n<p>In addition to freedom of expression, GNI and its members believe in respecting user privacy rights, including initiatives to increase <a href=\"https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/policy-issues/surveillance/\">transparency and accountability in government surveillance</a>. We believe that strong privacy rules and opposition to surveillance are a fundamental part of the freedom that allows people to read and contribute to Wikipedia.  The Wikimedia Foundation has taken a clear stance defending our users’ right to privacy by taking part in a<a href=\"https://policy.wikimedia.org/stopsurveillance/\"> lawsuit challenging the NSA’s upstream surveillance collection</a> activities and encrypting all traffic to and from Wikimedia projects through the <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/\">HTTPS protocol</a>. By taking concrete steps to defend user privacy, we are able to offer a unique perspective to other GNI members interested in how to better protect individuals. We hope that the connections we make within GNI will strengthen our own efforts to ensure that people are free to read and write Wikipedia without fear of anyone looking over their shoulder.</p>\n<p>The Wikimedia Foundation reflects our commitment to GNI’s mission in both our actions as the host of Wikipedia and our greater advocacy efforts through the Wikimedia movement. We are excited to collaborate with and learn from the variety of committed organizations and individuals who make up GNI in order to further these efforts to promote freedom of expression and privacy worldwide and ensure that everyone, everywhere can have access to knowledge.</p>\n<p><em>Jan Gerlach, Senior Public Policy Manager</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n","published":"2018-10-29T17:00:21.000Z","author":"Jan Gerlach","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/29/wikimedia-foundation-joins-the-global-network-initiative/","feed":{"source":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/feed/","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org","name":"Wikimedia Foundation"}},{"title":"How could Wikimedia Commons be improved? A conversation with designer George Oates","content":"<p>Earlier this year, the Wikimedia Foundation asked designer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Oates\">George Oates</a>, who has worked for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr\">Flickr</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive\">Internet Archive</a>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Library\">Open Library</a>, among others, to conduct a deep dive into <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/\">Wikimedia Commons</a>, the free media repository that provides many of the images used on Wikipedia. We wanted a fresh pair of eyeballs, and we were particularly interested in Oates’ observations about possible areas of improvement.</p>\n<p>Oates soon realized navigating Wikimedia Commons and finding interesting materials is challenging. She noted how the category system used to organize and tag media files on Commons is confusing and hides—not shows—the richness of content there. Other areas of improvement she mentioned include making both contributors and contributions more prominent and inviting, improving the user experience for new users, and actively recruiting more diverse gender participation in the project. (Oates noted that the group of administrators on Wikimedia Commons is internationally diverse, but not so much in terms of gender; this affects, for instance, the selection of featured images.)</p>\n<p>Oates also identified several ways in which Wikimedia Commons can work more fruitfully with GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums). This is partially due to her background in the field: over the last decade, she as worked on a series of projects that have reimagined how the world engages with the collections of libraries, archives, and museums on the web.</p>\n<p>She created <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/commons\">the Commons on Flickr,</a> which to this day stands as one of the most popular shared platforms for the world’s visual archives. She worked with the Internet Archive to lead the Open Library, a universal and openly editable catalog of the world’s books, connected to a digital lending library. More recently, she has worked with a variety of individual institutions to devise new ways of exploring their collections, like this experimental <a href=\"http://alpha.wellcomelibrary.org/\">interface</a> to the Wellcome Library collection in the UK.</p>\n<p>As we contemplate the future of cultural partnerships and the sharing of open collections in the Wikimedia movement, the Foundation asked George to do a short assignment: look at Wikimedia Commons through the lens of your background and experience, tell us candidly what you see, and suggest areas for improvement. We asked her to focus on the experience of new users, of cultural institutions, and to share with us some ideas of how Commons might evolve in the years ahead. Ben Vershbow (Director of Community Programs) and Sandra Fauconnier (Program Officer for GLAM and Structured Data) sat down with George to speak with her about her findings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ben: Please tell us about yourself!</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George:</strong> I’ve <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgeoates\">worked</a> on the web since 1996, mostly in design-centered roles.

You can see other people in it, and follow, copy, like, ignore, and meet them.</p>\n<p>This sort of socialising and movement happens on Commons too, but there’s an important difference between Commons, and, say, Facebook, and that’s that <em>the locals are building the city</em>. The ‘old school’ admins know the back alleys and the best noodles, and the Commons newbies head for the tourist hotspots.</p>\n<p>So, in terms of my first impressions, I faced three primary challenges to get to a position where I could present ideas, not just observe:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I am a newbie to the platform, unfamiliar with its rules, rituals and traditions</li>\n<li>There’s a major usability challenge: Information vs Interface</li>\n<li>The rules of engagement are not clear</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But, it also feels important to say that <strong><em>maybe there’s nothing wrong with it</em></strong>. The question in itself reveals a quiet tension. The Wikimedia Foundation’s team who support the Commons is in a hard, interesting position. They’re a crew of professional, philosophically aligned staff who find it difficult to help improve Commons. They meet resistance from the old guard, the community of volunteer admins and other long-term Commons folk who are there every day, have probably been there longer than anyone who works at the Foundation, feel deep ownership of the system, and can exercise deep control. They’ve patiently and visibly negotiated the dynamics of the system for the last fourteen years.</p>\n<p>So, the question becomes <em>what is it OK for the Wikimedia Foundation to do</em>?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ben: Yes, you’ve put your finger on a very delicate aspect of our work. Fortunately, we are finding ways to channel great ideas from the community into well-defined efforts to improve the platform. The prime example right now is our work to integrate Commons more tightly with Wikidata to improve discovery and to offer contributors and partners better ways of describing and organizing content (see </em><a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2017/01/09/sloan-foundation-structured-data/\"><em>here</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data\"><em>here</em></a><em>). </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Before we go deeper into your impressions of Commons, can you say a few words about your design philosophy and how you applied it during this assignment?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George: </strong>There are two main themes in my work that come to bear here:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Challenging the dominance of search as primary digital cultural interface</em></strong></p>\n<p>Many of the web projects I’ve made recently focus on explorability of gigantic cultural collections. I use the prompt “what happens if there’s no search box?” to help you find things. How can you show the shape and contour of a collection to allow people to follow their nose and sniff out the things that interest them?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Importance of copywriting in interface design</em></strong></p>\n<p>Wiki systems are always a battle of <strong>Information vs Interface</strong>. The more functional pages you need to use the thing also take the time to explain and define themselves. It can be so <em>informative</em> it’s overwhelming.</p>\n<p>Wikis are also written by many. At Flickr, I wrote a lot of the interface copy; the “system voice” was largely mine, and therefore, consistent. On Commons, you don’t know who is telling you what. This opacity can be confusing if you’re expected to follow certain rules, but don’t know who’s setting them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ben: So what did you learn as you delved deeper into Commons?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George: </strong>It’s huge and arcane. And successful. “Anyone can contribute” means that all sorts do, and there are now about 50 million things there. That’s astonishing.</p>\n<p>But, there’s very little sense of the scale or depth of the thing. It’s one thing to say there are all those things that anyone can use, but it’s another to show them all. Newbie explorers are confronted with a vast textual category system including an obscure interface element to show contents of each category… can you tell what it means?</p>\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-59317\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Electical-engineering-category-screenshot.png?w=323\" alt=\"\" width=\"323\" height=\"383\" /></div>\n<p><strong><em>Categories are a beautiful disaster</em></strong></p>\n<p>The various Wikipedias work so beautifully because they embrace the networked nature of information. Pages are stronger (and accepted) when they interconnect across the system. Wikipedians joke about getting “lost down the rabbit hole”, where you’re at one place at one minute then you look up an hour later and you’re somewhere completely different. This is because all of the entries are deliberately and delicately interconnected.</p>\n<p>Commons is not like that. Even though there are about 6 million “<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data/About/FAQ\">multi-hierarchichal</a>” categories, the majority of files are only in one category, as this 2017 research shows:</p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\">\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\">\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\" id=\"attachment_59318\"><div class=\"img-in-text\"><img class=\"wp-image-59318 size-large\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SDoC_baseline_-_Number_of_files_by_number_of_categories.png?w=1000\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></div><div class=\"img-caption\"><span class=\"photo-caption\"></span> <span class=\"photo-credit\"></span></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>If you select <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images\">Images</a> at the top of the homepage, you see a list of categories of <em>types</em> of image, not <em>types of things</em> in images. That’s tricky if you’re looking for a photo of a flower and not <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_by_resolution\">Images by Resolution</a>. There are also Topics on the homepage, which operate a little more like you’d expect. You can click on <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mathematics\">Mathematics</a>, then explore <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Chirality_in_mathematics\">Chirality in Mathematics</a> or <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Sets_of_mathematical_objects\">Sets of Mathematical Objects</a>. I was able to find what might be the best category in the history of categories though: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Potato_truncated_from_cube_to_predicate_lattice\">Potato truncated from cube to predicate lattice</a>. <strong>Does that sound like a category to you?</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Showing the actors</strong></em></p>\n<p>I was surprised the thousands of people participating aren’t more obvious. Who’s editing what? Which people like which categories? Who is uploading a lot? Who’s helping other people? I became interested in who the admins were, how/when rules were established, and how decisions are made. If we think in terms of locals and tourists, who are the actors who know what’s happening, who I could ask for advice, or imitate?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Encouraging description</strong></em></p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\">\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\">\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\" id=\"attachment_59319\"><div class=\"img-in-text\"><img class=\"wp-image-59319 size-large\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The_approach_of_the_spirits_.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" /></div><div class=\"img-caption\"><span class=\"photo-caption\"></span> <span class=\"photo-credit\"></span></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When you get to a media file, like this fabulous <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%22The_approach_of_the_spirits%22.png\">The approach of the spirits</a>, there’s nowhere to jump across to; no way to see images like the one you’ve just discovered. Its categories are listed as <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PD-Art_(PD-US-1923)\">PD-Art (PD-US-1923)</a> and <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Illustrations\">Illustrations</a>. Nothing like <em>myth</em>, <em>stories</em>, <em>night</em>, <em>spirits</em>, <em>stars</em>, or <em>the night sky</em>.</p>\n<p>Not being able to move sideways is a huge weakness of any hierarchical structure. It can also be difficult to navigate a hierarchy unless you know its whole structure. You’re constantly going into a branch then back out again, instead of skipping across an interconnected collection. That said, the new work on interconnected Commons infoboxes looks really promising, e.g. <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:St._Paul%27s_Cathedral\">Category:St. Paul’s Cathedral</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s no limit to how many categories a digital object could belong to. How could the system be improved to allow more and different descriptions? As with many traditional cultural collections, an object’s metadata is revisited rarely, so instead of a live database of media like Flickr, where objects enjoy a very social existence, a thinly described object in a sea of 50 million is practically invisible.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Rules of engagement</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>“At the start of my wiki-journey, I was left to fend for myself. It felt akin to being surrounded by hungry beasts and wondering why you&#8217;re still alive&#8230;” –</em><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pyfan\">Pyfan</a></p>\n<p>While it’s also easy or almost trite to say that Wikis are transparent democracies where anyone can participate, I also read quite a lot that people feel really intimidated when they first “come to the party”.  The category structure might also have evolved into what’s there today because the rules of engagement are dense, and the interface when you try to add or enhance things is obtuse.</p>\n<p>As I did my research, I asked a few questions in the IRC channel, or on the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump\">Village Pump</a> (which is really well run, by the way). Answers would be presented, and be useful, but, they referenced pages that I bet would have taken me forever to find, if I could find them at all. They often displayed old “votes” or decisions made by a very few, and not revisited, or with no recourse to revisit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have any tips and direct feedback for the Wikimedia Commons community?</em></strong></p>\n<p>It’s <em>amazing</em>!!</p>\n<p>Like I said, I remain interested in the administration of the thing. In this self-governing system, how are rules created? How do those rules percolate to the newbies? How visible are they? And most importantly, who is making them?</p>\n<p>There are about 225 admins for 7.2 million accounts on Commons. It’s a media library built by 7 million, but not all are editing and adding things all the time. In fact, the Wikimedia Foundation suggests about <a href=\"https://stats.wikimedia.org/v2/#/commons.wikimedia.org/contributing/editors/normal%7Cline%7C2-Year%7C~total\">32,000 folks a month</a> are active, but even so, the system is administered by just 0.00003% of the population.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Diversity in administration / representation / arbitration</em></strong></p>\n<p>I looked into who the Commons admins are, with the data to hand.[1] Here’s a graph that shows <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful_requests_for_adminship\">how many admins were brought on each year</a>, and how many from each year “survived” as admins.</p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\">\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\">\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\" id=\"attachment_59320\"><div class=\"img-in-text\"><img class=\"wp-image-59320 size-large\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Added-and-surviving-admins.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"630\" /></div><div class=\"img-caption\"><span class=\"photo-caption\"></span> <span class=\"photo-credit\"></span></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>I also looked at each admin’s page, and noted whenever I could see a declared gender (using names or photos etc). Here’s the breakdown of admin community demographics:</p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\" id=\"attachment_59322\"><div class=\"img-in-text\"><img class=\"wp-image-59322 size-large\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Admin-community-demographics.png?w=512\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"312\" /></div><div class=\"img-caption\"><span class=\"photo-caption\"></span> <span class=\"photo-credit\"></span></div></div>\n<p>The geographical and language spread of the admins seems pretty good. There are people from different countries, who often also participate in their language Wikipedia and/or the EN Wikipedia, and sometimes even work for, or have worked for, the Foundation. But, even in a best case scenario (where the “unspecified” category from the pie chart was actually about 50/50 women and men, that would still be 66% men and 33% women as declared administrators. There also aren’t many new folks. This might be because the rules of engagement take a while to take in and operate at a sophisticated level. Perhaps it’s also a place to inject diversity, particularly around the things that require some kind of vote or consensus.</p>\n<p>Also interesting to note at this point that Hong Kong has a police force of 34,000.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fostering diversity</em></strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://seejane.org/about-us/\">Geena Davis Research Institute</a> was founded in 2004 to study and shift the balance of representation of women and girls in media. Their tagline is “<em>if she can see it, she can be it</em>,” and the institute has done groundbreaking research about how to measure the presence of women and men in films, mostly, to demonstrate the presence of unconscious bias in our media. The stats are telling.</p>\n<p>One of the very simple ways the institute suggests to check when you’re making a movie is that all the crowd scenes contain 50/50 women and men. I really like this. It’s easy to check and simple to do. If we apply this idea to Commons, one place to look for an “equal crowd” is the various Highlights areas, like Photo of the Day, or <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Meet_our_photographers\">Meet our photographers</a>. Today, those lists are mostly of men, and even some of the older admins.</p>\n<p>Those public lists are a place to look for fostering more diverse representation in the community. How could the procedure for creating those lists be realigned with a positive and welcomed diversity agenda?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Changing precedents</em></strong></p>\n<p>During my research, I was shocked to see a photograph of a naked woman show up on the homepage of Commons, marked as Photo of the Day. I went to the Help Desk to ask “Why is OK to have a picture of a nude woman on the homepage?” I wasn’t crying OMG P0RN!, but suggesting that the image may be an alienating first image for some to encounter. It’s worth <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Help_desk&amp;oldid=305803393#Why_is_it_OK_to_have_a_picture_of_a_nude_woman_on_the_home_page?\">having a read</a> (and a mark of the strength of a wiki’s nature that I can retrieve the conversation). For me, it was telling that the rebuttals to my query ranged from tired responses around “pornography or art”, or that “galleries are full of naked women”, to more more resigned responses like “it’s already been decided”, or, “But this is the Internet, where the opinions of Western young men dominate, so good luck getting any sort of grown-up discussion about that.”</p>\n<p>The fact that there the system is full of old decisions that are no longer questioned is a problem. You can see how it’s now handed out as a “it’s the way we’ve always done it” response here, as another helpful person <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Village_pump&amp;oldid=305254391#Objection_to_placement_of_non-notable_naked_recumbent_woman_on_homepage_today\">chipped in with support for my query</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Featured_picture_candidates/File:Fine-art-nudesunpine.jpg\">see the original voting process in action, in November 2013</a>, which pushed the photo of the naked woman into the picture of the day category. (Warning: you’ll also see the naked woman on that page.) Of the 18 votes cast, at least 17 of them were by men, 3 of whom were admins, many of whom have been on Commons 5+ years, and a handful of whom are also featured photographers.</p>\n<p>I realise that this file and its life on Commons may be an easy target, but, it’s also indicative of the oligarchal participation and representation on Commons.</p>\n<p>What if featured photographs votes require a more representative voter group? What if you, as a user, could only have 10 featured photographs? What if the “Featured” lists were removed entirely?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the design of Wikimedia Commons in general, to make it easier to use?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George: </strong>If we’re talking about making it easier to use for individuals using the web interface, then yes, I do.</p>\n<p>There are just five user pages and one email in the UI that could be improved to help new folks get grounded. Making them crisp and instructional instead of information vs interface would have a huge effect. It’s about decluttering the copy and trying to help the new person figure out what to do first. The pages are <strong>User</strong>, (and <strong>welcome email</strong>), <strong>User talk</strong>, <strong>Watchlist</strong>, <strong>User contributions</strong>, and <strong>File list</strong>.</p>\n<p>For example, here’s the current Welcome email, the first point of contact from the Commons to an individual:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Hi there [Username],</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Welcome to Wikimedia Commons! Someone (probably you) from IP address 51.148.133.195, has registered an account “[Username]” with your email address here. We’re glad you decided to join us.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>What next? First you should confirm your account.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>To confirm that this account really does belong to you and activate email features on Wikimedia Commons, open this link in your browser:</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>After that, you’ll see ideas on how to get started and links to help you learn about Wikimedia Commons.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>From all of us here at Wikimedia Commons, welcome aboard!</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>If you did *not* register the account, follow this link to cancel the email address confirmation:</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>This confirmation code will expire at 13:53, 13 June 2018.</em></p>\n<p>This asks more questions than it answers, and even casts doubt on me being a legitimate user! “Someone (probably you) / “to confirm this account really does belong to you…” come across as defensive and doubtful. Hardly a friendly welcome for someone new.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the difference if you make it more concise:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Hi [Username],</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Welcome to Wikimedia Commons, the world’s free media library!</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Your first step is to confirm your email address, please:</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Once that’s done, there are a few ways we recommend getting started:</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>• Read the Policies and Guidelines of contributing to Wikimedia Commons<br />\n</em><em>• Take a Photo Challenge or Upload your first media file<br />\n</em><em>• Help improve information about Commons resources<br />\n</em><em>• Have a look around your account settings</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>Good luck! And if you get stuck, please visit the Community Help Centre.</em></p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that I have absolutely no idea how I—an interested interface designer—could independently contribute effort towards making this part of the system better, just like I can edit regular entries.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Seeing each other</strong></em></p>\n<p>One of the reasons I think Flickr and other social systems are so successful is because we can <em>see each other </em>when we use them. They show people their own stuff, other people’s stuff, allow them to follow/connect/gather, show the activity happening—<em>particularly on your stuff because we all love that</em>—and often, give a short list of things to try next, to show the way through. We learn from the way other people act and operate in the physical world, and that’s the same on a software platform.</p>\n<p>The foundation is there on Commons to enhance representations of scale, activity, and actors to help people see each other more clearly. Improving those five core screens with these themes in mind would help locate new people in the system, and give them only as much information as they need, when they need it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ben: And what about suggestions on how to invite more and better contributions to Commons?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George: </strong>I would try to make it much more obvious that viewers can improve metadata; provide much clearer calls to action to interested people. I mean, it’s somewhat implied, given that it’s a Wikimedia system, but, as far as I can tell, the call to action to improve the metadata about a file is a small Edit link next to the Summary heading on the item’s page.</p>\n<p>Here’s the Pied-winged swallow, Picture of the Day on 3 September:</p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\">\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-59358\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pied-winged-piper-box.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"207\" /></div>\n</div>\n<p>If you have the gumption to click “Edit”, you get this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-59326\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pied-winged-swallow-2.png?w=512\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"293\" /></p>\n<p>So, even if you wanted to add information about the image &#8212; e.g. it’s taken outside, there’s blue sky, it’s a bird, etc &#8212; you have to figure out the editing code/pseudo code and its UI. I tried to add “tag=bird” for example, and it threw an error. It’s very different from having a UI designed specifically to encourage contributions and conversation. It’s not simple. (I realise that “special” images, like Picture of the Day, have protected edit capacity to prevent vandalism.)</p>\n<p>There’s a ton of uploading that happens to Commons that&#8217;s not through the UI, but with lots of other tools written to streamline the process. (That’s another strength of the system, and was at Flickr for that matter—that people can contribute to it through all sorts of interfaces.) I found myself wondering if another way to improve contributions to Commons might be to focus on the connective tissue between the various Wikimedia platforms, in the UI. If I upload an image to Commons, I could be actively prompted to create or enhance a Wikipedia page…</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have suggestions on how to make Wikimedia Commons a more interesting and useful platform for external organizations (e.g. GLAMs) to work with our communities and make their knowledge available?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>George: </strong>I would look at three main areas around usefulness for institutions:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Reporting</strong></em></p>\n<p>Demonstrating use of collections, especially in a digital context, is especially difficult for institutions. If their stuff is nestled cosily amongst about 50 million other things, how and when can they know if the effort they’ve put in to sharing their treasures in the Commons is effective? Can any use of materials be reported on? Can that be established as new, legitimate usage of an institution’s materials? How can it be more refined, or indeed, more accurate than the mysterious “page view”. How can Commons help institutions (and individuals) see when their stuff is used? Something like the old school <a href=\"https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2009/01/21/2008-dopplr-per.html\">Dopplr Annual Report</a>, perhaps?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Presentation and presence</strong></em></p>\n<p>As I understand it, institutions either create a <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings_in_the_Nationalmuseum_Stockholm\">category</a> or use <a href=\"http://zone47.com/crotos/?p195=2817221\">a totally different system</a> to see all their media in one place. Can it provide a good destination for institutions to share around? What could their “User” page be like?</p>\n<p>If you look at the Wikipedia page for a contributing institution, e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalmuseum\">Nationalmuseum Stockholm</a>, you see this little box at the bottom:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-59327\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nationalmuseum-Stockholm-box.png?w=246\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"67\" /></p>\n<p>Even just rephrasing that to say “Explore the Nationalmuseum Stockholm’s 2,400 contributions to Wikimedia Commons” or perhaps creating another box that does that might be a start. That link also takes me to <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Nationalmuseum_Stockholm\">Category:Nationalmuseum Stockholm</a>, but it’s not immediately clear which items are from the collection versus about the institution.</p>\n<p>There’s obviously a question about whether institutions should be treated differently in the Commons context. I’m not sure about that. Perhaps it would be better to look for a way to enhance anyone’s presence equally. If part of the claimed benefit of participating in Commons is that metadata may be improved, visibility into the material also needs to be improved. What about a link on the home page to a list that shows all of the institutions?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Supporting people doing great stuff</strong></em></p>\n<p>When I was doing research, I attended a Wiki-a-thon at the Wellcome Collection in London. It was a day dedicated to improving the presence of women involved in medicine on Wikipedia. There were about eight people in the room, including the Wellcome Wikimedian in Residence, Alice. It was brilliant, and I could not have created my article on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Stone\">Clara Stone</a> without Alice in the room. The simple act of having a living human who could explain the rules and secret doors (like, you need to make 10 edits before you can make a page) instantly made the whole process more approachable.</p>\n<p>Human Wikimedian presence in cultural institutions can really help bridge the gap that’s sometimes perceived between authority and the crowd, which can be difficult for institutions to conquer on their own. This mediation is hugely valuable, and something that the Foundation could continue to support directly, and more. What if there was a Wikimedian in Residence at every national library in the world? (And lots of the smaller ones too?!?)</p>\n<p>I was also surprised to discover that lots of the updates to Commons are done en masse, through scripts and other programmes developed by volunteers. What sorts of other support could the Foundation provide for these folks? How can it support this developer community even more than it does now?

Yes, there are simple interface changes that could be made to continue to improve usability, but there’s a huge challenge for Commons (and other huge collections online like Europeana and DPLA) to improve description of their millions of things so they’re easier to see.</p>\n<p>As we’ve <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appointment_and_confirmation_to_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States\">just seen in the United States</a>, oligarchies don’t like change and giving up control, but what if <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16385\">diversity trumps ability</a>?</p>\n<p>These vast online collections will eventually see a return of the power and delicacy of curation. Only machines can consume 50 million things, and even then they might not be sure exactly what those things are, and if they find something interesting they won’t know who to tell. Computers “<a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/discovery/homo-faber\">scan everything and hear nothing</a>,” so we need all kinds of humans from all over the world to help gather our histories into meaningful units, but right now, Commons is a pretty closed system.</p>\n<p>Imagine if Commons could become like one of the great old cities of the world, full of all kinds of people from all kinds of places instead of a big city run by a tiny group of people who basically look the same?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">———</p>\n<p><em>Interview by Ben Vershbow, Director, Community Programs<br />\nSandra Fauconnier, Program Officer, Community Programs<br />\nWikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n<h3>Footnote</h3>\n<p>[1] The admin data consists of two views: (1) The list on the right side of the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators\">Commons:Administrators</a> page, and (2) those users listed on the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful_requests_for_adminship\">Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful requests for adminship</a>, which I edited manually to separate users who’d ever been admins from those who remain admins.

The event was a great success thanks to support from the Government of Malaysia, UNESCO YouthMobile Initiative and Officience. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unesco-hackathon.devpost.com/submissions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24 project teams</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were formed during the Hackathon. With the dedication of team members and mentorship from facilitators, all teams managed to complete their hacks. It was challenging for the judges to make their final decision as all proposed solutions appeared to be innovative and applicable. The three winning teams were Klima Kage, Climap &amp; Bird&#8217;s Eye View. Additionally, the judges also selected three runner-ups ThreeWolves, DBTFC &amp; GreenELF, whose projects directly address the issues related to climate change in the country.</span></p>\n<h4>Winning Projects: Klima Kage, Bird&#8217;s Eye View and Climap</h4>\n<p><strong>Klima Kage </strong>is a website application which consists of two parts: main page and community page. The main page contains data from open source database and tutorials extracted from the UNESCO handbook for journalists on climate change and sustainable development in Asia Pacific, which directly assist journalists in selecting data to monitor.</p>\n<p>On the community side, there is a forum for discussion and a news section where relevant articles will be published. The team decided to give priority to female journalists (ration 6:4) in reviewing and releasing news articles on this page, as a way to raise public awareness on gender dimension. SUSI.AI was also integrated into the web app to record users’ behaviour and offer suggestions for their next visits.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_17655\" style=\"width: 750px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-attachment-id=\"17655\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/unesco-hackathon-vietnam-2018-wrap-up/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?fit=750%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-17655\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?resize=750%2C563&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?resize=750%2C563&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?resize=267%2C200&amp;ssl=1 267w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44065165_198036261086437_121780546387836928_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Klima Kage (Sieben) Team</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Bird’s Eye View</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a mobile game built in unity with an objective to educate people about the impacts of climate change on all kind of creatures under the sea.

The Unconference grants youths the opportunity to connect with professionals, mentors, and one another, bringing over 100 individuals from several countries to share their innovation experiences. From Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Indigenous Canada, DOT works with governments, the private sector and community-based organizations to support youth striving to transform their societies as social innovators, digital ambassadors, and leaders.</p>\n<p>This year, the conference was held in Nairobi, Kenya and centered around the theme of inclusivity &#8211; specifically, closing the gender gap in technology. The first morning plenary session was opened by DOT CEO and founder, Janet Longmore, who spoke on the rise of social entrepreneurship, innovation and business. “Think about how you can contribute in the world of humanity, because the challenge we face cannot be solved with one or two individuals,” Longmore said. “A way to truly create an inclusive world is through passion, skill, and talent of social innovators.”</p>\n<p>And passionate, talented social innovators we met! DIAL had the privilege to learn about several individuals and their journeys to create and apply digital solutions to achieve positive social change in their communities. For example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelChatina\">Emmanuel Chatina</a> has developed a social enterprise that leverages mobile phones to offer remote healthcare to those who would otherwise not have ready access to health providers.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/297356904\" width=\"350\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p>Others are addressing the invisible form of health and seek to destigmatize dialogue surrounding it. Eunice Njeghe, Angela Mumbi, Walder Amani, and Latifa Noor promote mental health and connect individuals in Kenya to mental health providers through their mobile application, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BeingPsych\">PsychBeing</a>, while Yvonne Osagie from Ottawa is currently developing an online platform devoted to education, support, and prevention of sexual abuse on college campuses.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/297356951\" width=\"350\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/297356989\" width=\"350\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p>And digital technologies are not only being used, but taught: in addition to training young girls and women in the latest technologies, Ivy Barley, co-founder of <a href=\"https://developersinvogue.org/\">Developers in Vogue</a>, helps them navigate the tech space and connects them to real-time projects and jobs, doing her part in closing the gender divide in tech.</p>\n<p>As we learned about the different ways in which digital technology extends social services to traditionally underserved communities across multiple geographies and sectors, we also had the opportunity to introduce many of the participants to the <a href=\"digitalprinciples.org\">Digital Principles</a> and share how the Principles can help guide their work and achieve sustainability. Participants who attended our Digital Principles session shared the challenges they face when implementing their solutions, the resources they wish they had available, and how they believed the Principles could be helpful in addressing these issues. Many insights shared by participants showcased common problems in the ICT sector and demonstrated how it is never too early to begin putting the Principles into practice.</p>\n<p>The Unconference was an incredibly powerful and inspiring experience; we look forward to having DOT youths’ voices join and help shape the future of the Digital Principles as they continue to develop into tomorrow’s innovators and leaders bringing digital solutions to global communities.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/transforming-communities-how-dot-youth-use-innovation-and-the-digital-principles-to-achieve-positive-social-impact/\">Transforming Communities: How DOT Youth use innovation and the Digital Principles to achieve positive social impact</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org\">DIAL</a>.</p>\n","published":"2018-10-26T17:30:40.000Z","author":"Claudine Lim","link":"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/transforming-communities-how-dot-youth-use-innovation-and-the-digital-principles-to-achieve-positive-social-impact/","feed":{"source":"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/feed/","link":"https://digitalimpactalliance.org","name":"DIAL"}},{"title":"Apertura 14as Jornadas Internacionales de gvSIG","content":"[object Object]","published":"2018-10-25T18:03:52.000Z","author":"Alvaro","link":"https://blog.gvsig.org/2018/10/25/apertura-14as-jornadas-internacionales-de-gvsig/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Junção espacial 5x mais rápida com PostGIS","content":"[object Object]","published":"2018-10-25T10:30:26.000Z","author":"Fernando Quadro","link":"http://www.fernandoquadro.com.br/html/2018/10/25/juncao-espacial-5x-mais-rapida-com-postgis/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Announcing the release of Postgres-XL 10R1","content":"<p><strong>Oxford, United Kingdom - October 25, 2018</strong></p> <p>2ndQuadrant today announced the release of <a href=\"https://www.postgres-xl.org/\">Postgres-XL 10R1</a>, now available for download <a href=\"https://www.postgres-xl.org/downloads/postgres-xl-10r1.tar.gz\">here</a>.</p> <p>Postgres-XL is a massively parallel database built on top of - and very closely compatible with - community PostgreSQL.

Yet, from 19 to 21 September, Wikimedians, art curators, and scientists <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Wikidata_for_research/Meetups/2018-09-19-21-New-York\">gathered at the New Museum</a> in New York City’s Lower East Side for a three-day workshop to talk about an emerging technology designed to make storing and structuring data free and accessible. The focal point was an increasingly vital piece of the Wikimedia ecosystem that makes linked data possible for everyone: Wikibase.</p>\n<p>Wikibase is a little-known standalone piece of software that powers Wikimedia’s popular new linked-data project <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page\">Wikidata</a>.  (This is similar to how Wikipedia is powered by a general wiki software called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki\">MediaWiki</a>, which is used everywhere from NASA to MuppetWiki.)  Since 2012, Wikidata has been growing to fill an increasingly important role in the Wikimedia community: connecting, sharing and providing tools for turning Wikipedia’s text strings into useful, searchable, machine-readable.  Wikidata’s content informs research and cultural heritage institutions, as well as digital tools like Google’s Knowledge Graph. None of this would be possible without Wikibase—which makes the Wikidata’s linked open data project possible and practical.</p>\n<p>In the last few years, an expanding community of researchers, GLAMs, and other knowledge communities have been experimenting with using Wikibase for their own repositories of knowledge, distinct from the central Wikidata knowledge collected by Wikimedians. But this nascent community of Wikibase reusers is just emerging, and deploying an open source technology not originally designed for third-party use can be challenging.</p>\n<p>The September Wikidata workshop gathered a subgroup of these pioneering data explorers to better understand how to realize Wikibase as a robust independent project distinct from the Wikidata platform, and to turn it into a tool that can offer core infrastructure for the work of scholars and GLAMs as they collect, describe and analyze their diverse stores of both facts and artifacts.  The key question: how could Wikibase reach and meet the needs of professionals across a broad community of emerging and established institutions.</p>\n<p>The gathering was made possible through a generous grant by the Sloan Foundation.  It was hosted and sponsored by one of the early adopters of this technology, <a href=\"http://rhizome.org\">Rhizome</a> (documented in our Many Faces of Wikibase <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/\">blog series</a>), and co-organized with <a href=\"https://wikimedia.de/en\">Wikimedia Germany (Deutschland)</a>.</p>\n<h3>What do you talk about in a Wikibase workshop?</h3>\n<p>The Wikibase workshop began with talks by participants highlighting their work in the realms of Wikidata, Wikibase, and more generally representing and working with linked data. Participants came with varying levels of experience with Wikidata and Wikibase, from interested newcomers to intrepid early adopters of the technology.  So, the presentations created an important baseline understanding of what is happening with Wikibase and what its possibilities and pain points are.</p>\n<p>Day one explored both the many opportunities and the number of underlying concerns exploring and integrating a new technology. Are we the only ones experiencing challenges? Are there tools that could help us solve our problems? What kind of future can we build for increasing adoption of the software?</p>\n<p>At the same time presenters brought striking examples of advanced use.  Digital art specialists described how they use Wikimedia tools for art preservation <em>Rhizome </em><a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/\">using Wikibase</a>, and <em>SFMOMA</em> using Mediawiki. Michigan State University’s <a href=\"http://enslaved.org/\">Enslaved.org</a> and Pratt University’s <a href=\"https://linkedjazz.org/\">Linked Jazz Project</a> showed off the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@thisismattmiller/wikibase-for-research-infrastructure-part-1-d3f640dfad34\">power of wikibase and linked data for exploring the cultural record</a>.  GLAM professionals from the Smithsonian, New York’s METRO library consortium, and York University highlighted the potential applications of Wikidata to their own varied and vast collections spaces.</p>\n<p>During the second day, we broke into working groups focused on understanding practical ways which Wikibase can be better supported for arts and research communities. Tracks focused on UI/UX improvements, making Wikibase easier to install and use, developing a Wikibase community, improving data modeling on Wikibase. The groups each provided <a href=\"https://notepad.rhizome.org/s/LOD-Wikibase-Summit-NYC\">pages of documentation and specific recommendations</a> that can be used as part of Wikibase’s development going forward (including, for example, <a href=\"https://notepad.rhizome.org/zMnfc5tPTwa8ajcUiTzPQA?both\">concept sketches</a> for changes to the platform that would help GLAM and humanities researchers use Wikibase).</p>\n<p>By day three, the community in the room had a strong sense of solidarity and shared purpose: that we can imagine are future in which Wikibase powers GLAM and research institutions to strengthen the exchange and connection of knowledge. We wrapped up the workshop with a session of sharing and reflecting, and then finished documenting the event, with next steps and links to notes on the conference meetup page, technical feature requests on phabricator tickets, and this very blog post.</p>\n<h3>It’s more than just gathering together—it’s about creating a community</h3>\n<p>An overwhelming theme throughout the workshop was the questions of, <em>what’s next</em>? In the wrapup conversations, the answers came back to facilitating a growing community of users who want to apply the Wikibase technology to the work of researchers and GLAMs. Key to forming the community would be figuring out what stories we can tell, and how we can tell them to new audiences.</p>\n<p>Most of the participants in the New York Workshop were new users of Wikibase—very much still learning. In a community-driven environment like Wikimedia, sometimes the best outcome of an event is developing a larger community of knowledge-holders, of individuals able to explain, support and facilitate understanding of a practice or set of projects. With the Wikibase workshop, we helped a larger group of community members share their knowledge and gain knowledge from others. So, the next time a question arises on the <a href=\"https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikibaseug\">Wikibase users mailing list</a>, or a colleague expresses as interest in Wikibase, they know who else to connect with. In short: the workshop helped produce more nodes in our growing Wikibase linked data network.</p>\n<p>This budding community would not have been able to form without the amazing facilitation of Dragan Espenschied (<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q111053\">Q111053</a> on Wikidata) from Rhizome and Sandra Müllrick from Wikimedia Deutschland, along with their teams.  The organizers facilitated a collegial, knowledge exchange that can lead to a growing web of Wikibase users and community participants.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Stinson, Senior Strategist, Community Programs, Wikimedia Foundation</em><br />\n<em>Jake Orlowitz, The Wikipedia Library, Community Programs, Wikimedia Foundation</em><br />\n<em>Jens Ohlig, Software Communications Strategist, Software Development, Wikimedia Germany (Deutschland)</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>To learn more about Wikibase or the growing community of Wikibase users, join the conversation on the </em><a href=\"https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikibaseug\"><em>Wikibase community mailing list </em></a><em> or the </em><a href=\"https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikidata\"><em>Wikidata community mailing list</em></a><em>, follow the </em><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Status_updates\"><em>Wikidata Weekly status updates</em></a><em>, and share your stories with </em><em>jens.ohlig</em><em>[at]</em><em>wikimedia[dot]org</em>.</p>\n","published":"2018-10-24T16:00:22.000Z","author":"Alex Stinson, Jake Orlowitz and Jens Ohlig","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/24/wikibasenyc-conference/","feed":{"source":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/feed/","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org","name":"Wikimedia Foundation"}},{"title":"Big Data Spatial com GeoMesa","content":"[object Object]","published":"2018-10-24T10:30:49.000Z","author":"Fernando Quadro","link":"http://www.fernandoquadro.com.br/html/2018/10/24/big-data-spatial-com-geomesa/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"PipelineDB v1.0.0 Now Available as a PostgreSQL Extension under the Apache 2.0 Open-Source License","content":"<p>PipelineDB, which enables high-throughput continuous aggregation of streaming time-series data, released v1.0.0 today as an open-source PostgreSQL extension under the Apache 2.0 license.

It enhances and complements the built-in replication capabilities in PostgreSQL; making it easy to set up and manage standby servers, check replication status, and perform administrative tasks such as switchover operations. The repmgrd daemon provides automatic failover capability to maximize database uptime, and can easily be integrated with other tools such as PgBouncer for high application availability.</p> <p>The principal new feature of repmgr 4.2 is the ability to \"pause\" the repmgr daemon (repmgrd) via the <a href=\"https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgr-daemon-pause.html\">repmgr daemon pause</a> and the corresponding <a href=\"https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgr-daemon-unpause.html\">repmgr daemon unpause</a> commands. These will temporarily prevent it from taking failover action. This is useful for activities like planned maintenance (e.g. database upgrades or switchovers) which previously required repmgrd to be shut down on all nodes. <a href=\"https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgr-standby-switchover.html\">repmgr standby switchover</a> will automatically pause/unpause repmgrd, simplifying switchover operations. </p> <p>Additionally, the new <a href=\"https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgr-daemon-status.html\">repmgr daemon status</a> command is available to provide an overview of repmgrd status on all nodes.</p> <p>For more details on this functionality, see the detailed <a href=\"https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgrd-pausing.html\">documentation</a>.</p> <p>repmgr 4.2 also provides several usability enhancements:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Add new parameter shutdown_check_timeout (default: 60 seconds).</strong> This provides an explicit timeout for repmgr standby switchover to check that the demotion candidate (current primary) has shut down. </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Add new parameter repmgr_ bindir.</strong> This facilitates remote invocation of repmgr when the repmgr binary is located somewhere other than the PostgreSQL binary directory, as it cannot be assumed all package maintainers will install repmgr there. This parameter is optional; if not set (default), repmgr will fall back to pg_ bindir (if set).</p> </li> <li> <p>repmgr cluster cleanup now accepts the --node-id option to delete records for only one node.</p> </li> <li> <p>When running repmgr cluster matrix and repmgr cluster crosscheck, repmgr will report nodes unreachable via SSH, and emit return code ERR_BAD_SSH. </p> </li> </ul> <p>For a detailed list of all changes, please read the complete release notes <a href=\"https://repmgr.org/docs/dev/release-4.2.html\">here</a>.</p> <p>Upgrade instructions are available <a href=\"https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/upgrading-repmgr-extension.html#UPGRADING-MAJOR-VERSION\">here</a>.</p> <p>Packages and installation documentation are available via 2ndQuadrant’s public RPM and APT repositories from 2ndQuadrant <a href=\"https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/installation-packages.html\">here</a>.</p> <p>Source files can be downloaded <a href=\"https://repmgr.org/download/repmgr-4.2.tar.gz\">here</a> and installation instructions are available <a href=\"https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/installation.html\">here</a>.</p> <p>repmgr is distributed under GPL v3.</p> <p>For more information, please send an email to <a href=\"info@2ndQuadrant.com\">info@2ndQuadrant.com</a></p>","published":"2018-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","author":"","link":"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1899/","feed":{"source":"https://www.postgresql.org/news.rss","link":"https://www.postgresql.org/","name":"PostgreSQL news"}},{"title":"Nuevo partner del Liquid Galaxy LAB: stimulo, Agencia de Diseño de Producto e Innovación","content":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Rw9tBs-gMbc/W886knRpC-I/AAAAAAAGr-Y/7pO5hDXPYq8RA2GRm60e9YacJaUnBJZggCLcBGAs/s1600/stimulo-logo.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"130\" data-original-width=\"400\" height=\"104\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Rw9tBs-gMbc/W886knRpC-I/AAAAAAAGr-Y/7pO5hDXPYq8RA2GRm60e9YacJaUnBJZggCLcBGAs/s320/stimulo-logo.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><a href=\"http://www.stimulo.com/es/\">stimulo</a>, la Agencia de Diseño de Producto e Innovación, con sede en Barcelona y China, inicia su colaboración con los laboratorios TIC del Parc Cientific de Lleida, en este caso con el Liquid Galaxy LAB, desarrollando una carcasa diseñada especialmente para los niñxs y el entorno escolar de un kit AIY del Google Assistant.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p88BRK7Ng0U/W8870BPo4uI/AAAAAAAGr-k/SE1ZVkPUidsp3VJAHMV7bW9KpuIT8JXRwCLcBGAs/s1600/LiquidGalaxy%2Bfor%2BEducation%2Blogo.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"550\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"68\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p88BRK7Ng0U/W8870BPo4uI/AAAAAAAGr-k/SE1ZVkPUidsp3VJAHMV7bW9KpuIT8JXRwCLcBGAs/s200/LiquidGalaxy%2Bfor%2BEducation%2Blogo.jpeg\" width=\"200\" /></a></div><br />Esta carcasa tendrà como finalidad básica convertirse en pieza angular del interface de usuario del proyecto <a href=\"http://www.liquidgalaxylab.com/search/label/Liquid%20Galaxy%20for%20Education\">Liquid Galaxy para Educación</a>, en desarrollo actualmente en los laboratorios, el cual es una adaptación de la tecnologia Liquid Galaxy orientada a escuelas y otros centros educativos.

Per aquest motiu, està dissenyat per facilitar-los la iniciació mitjançant un conjunt de tasques, que proveeixen organitzacions com el Liquid Galaxy LAB del Parc Científic. Els preuniversitaris seleccionen les tasques i les treballen amb l’ajut d’un mentor durant vàries setmanes. Cada tasca té una durada de 3 a 5 hores i els estudiants disposen de 3 dies per acabar-la i després, si ho volen, continuar amb una de nova.<br /><br />Les tasques són de 5 tipus diferents i no únicament de programació, la qual cosa amplia a tots els escolars la possibilitat de presentar-s’hi. Al tractar-se d’un programa mundial, totes les preguntes, respostes i comunicacions es fan en anglès.<br /><br /><img height=\"139\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1WhH2ptYnjIoseZjQKliUhEftPNqsmIIrjRYsfoPn5ANAoi3daUCEBdJwUp4oC2_viPu7a1v20kvOg5GiL39l_EzdL6eN_9bzHuho5OknZR4zCfvodIPJd4gOypZqEvA_K_oPS-C\" width=\"640\" /><br /><br />El concurs està dotat amb diversos premis, que depenen del nombre de tasques que finalitzin i de quantes en facin els estudiants: des de diplomes de Google (1 tasca), samarretes (3 o més tasques), assuadores ii, fins i tot, guanyar un viatge a la central de Google, situada a Silicon Valley (Califòrnia), amb un familiar o tutor.<br /><br />Des del 2010, més de 4.500 estudiants de 99 països han participat en el programa Google Code-in. El Liquid Galaxy LAB del Parc Científic va gestionar el passat concurs 2017-2018 més de 500 estudiants de tot el món, entre els quals hi havia vàries dotzenes de lleidatans.<br /><br /><br /><b>Objectius </b>Que nenes i nens de Lleida i arreu del mòn aconsegueixin una experiència mundial única i amb una marca tan reconeguda com Google mitjançant la participació en aquesta nova edició. El Parc Científic, a través del seu laboratori Liquid Galaxy LAB, és un dels dissenyadors del programa. <br /><br /><b>Dates </b>El proper 23 d’octubre comença el termini per registrar-se i seleccionar les tasques a desenvolupar a través de la web <a href=\"https://codein.withgoogle.com/\">https://codein.withgoogle.com/</a>. <br />El concurs finalitza el 12 de desembre del 2018. Els estudiants necessiten un compte de Google per accedir-hi i un permís parental, que se’ls demana al registrar-se. Els participants han d’esperar que Google aprovi el permís abans de desenvolupar les tasques.<br /><br /><br /><b>Responsables </b>El Liquid Galaxy LAB, laboratori TIC del Parc Científic sota la coordinació d’Andreu Ibáñez i amb la col·laboració del Grup de Desenvolupadors Google de Lleida (GDG Lleida). Darrera hi ha un equip de 30 mentors de tot el món, que atenen els estudiants.<br /><br /><b>Contacte: lgcodein@gmail.com </b>","published":"2018-10-19T11:03:00.001Z","author":"Andreu Ibáñez","link":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4643387265233889970/posts/default/2018225826920690892","feed":{"source":"http://www.liquidgalaxylab.com/feeds/posts/default","name":"Liquid Galaxy LAB","link":"http://www.liquidgalaxylab.com/feeds/posts/default"}},{"title":"Els projectes del Liquid Galaxy LAB al Devfest Lleida 2018 - Català","content":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--9554nXnyjE/W8mxoVfMsqI/AAAAAAAGrw4/l8ElZ9dfAqQ11NAVabRjnca7_I1KNgeEwCLcBGAs/s1600/cartell-devfestlleida2018.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"978\" data-original-width=\"688\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--9554nXnyjE/W8mxoVfMsqI/AAAAAAAGrw4/l8ElZ9dfAqQ11NAVabRjnca7_I1KNgeEwCLcBGAs/s640/cartell-devfestlleida2018.PNG\" width=\"450\" /></a></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 26.7px; text-align: justify;\"><b><span lang=\"ES-TRAD\" style=\"font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;\"><br /></span></b></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 26.7px; text-align: justify;\"><b><span lang=\"ES-TRAD\" style=\"font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;\">El Google Devfest Lleida 2018 contra la bretxa digital per gènere<u></u><u></u></span></b></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 26.7px; text-align: justify;\"><b><span lang=\"ES-TRAD\" style=\"font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;\">Dones expertes en tecnologia animaran les noies a cursar estudis tecnològics<u></u><u></u></span></b></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 26.7px; text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 26.7px; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"ES-TRAD\" style=\"font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;\">El Google Devfest Lleida 2018 posarà el focus en la promoció de les vocacions tecnològiques entre les noies davant de l’existència d’una bretxa digital per raó de gènere.

(That number has since jumped to 17.67 percent, meaning an average of 72 new articles on women were added to English Wikipedia every single day for the past 3.5 years.)</p>\n<p>In the past three years, Women in Red has collaborated with outside institutions like museums and libraries that want to put on edit-a-thons, and developed lists of “redlinks”—non-existing Wikipedia articles—of women who should have material written about them. But the group doesn’t stop at biographies.</p>\n<p>“Our scope includes women&#8217;s works (such as the paintings they painted, the schools the founded, the conferences they convened), as well as women&#8217;s issues (such as women&#8217;s suffrage and women&#8217;s health),” says Stephenson-Goodnight.</p>\n<h3>A helpful space for newcomers</h3>\n<p>Women in Red is known for helping newcomers navigate the technical rules of Wikipedia—which can be overwhelming for new contributors. Sue Barnum, a volunteer Librarian-in-Residence with Women in Red, points to the group’s friendly and helpful nature as a key reason why it has been so successful.</p>\n<p>“We support one another and help each other with our articles, references and technical details. If you need help, we&#8217;re going to help or find someone who can,” she says. “I&#8217;ll try to help people get access to articles or books behind paywalls. Sometimes I&#8217;ll even go to nearby libraries to access the actual book to help people verify their sources if the book or journal is only available offline.”</p>\n<h3>The focus is on why women matter</h3>\n<p>Editor SusunW, a founding member of Women in Red, recently <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2018-05-24/Blog\">wrote an essay</a> about why she focuses on writing about women on Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>“I learn as much from writing women’s biographies as I impart from telling their stories,” she writes. “For example, in the pre-internet world, the international links between people and the organizations in which they participated were much stronger than you might imagine. The analytical part of researching the interconnections, and reward of working with editors who want to improve articles, is a motivating factor to me—as is the hope that the women in generations who follow will grow up knowing that women have always been actively involved in the world around them and were not passively allowing the world to go by.”</p>\n<p>Making women—and their role in history—more visible is a motivating factor for many participants to Women in Red.</p>\n<p>“I grew up believing that women didn&#8217;t do anything interesting,” says Barnum. “It&#8217;s sad that I believed that, because it isn&#8217;t true. I believed this because women&#8217;s contributions become invisible, especially after their deaths. There are many articles I&#8217;ve worked on where a woman was quite nationally famous during her lifetime, but after she dies, she somehow &#8220;fails&#8221; to make it into the canon that describes the subject she was involved in. This is really tragic and I&#8217;m glad that there are historians out there writing about women who have been hidden in history.”</p>\n<p><strong>You can make a difference</strong></p>\n<p>Inspired to join Women in Red?  There are many ways to get involved. For starters, Women in Red has put together a p<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Essays/Primer_for_creating_women%27s_biographies\">rimer for creating women&#8217;s biographies&#8221;</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Essays/Ten_Simple_Rules_for_Women_in_Red\">&#8220;ten Simple Rules for Creating Women&#8217;s Biographies&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a place to jump in, Barnum recommends starting with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Redlist_index\">the lists</a> that Women in Red has put together on women that are notable by Wikipedia’s standards and who need biographies written about them.</p>\n<p>“Pick someone from a subject area you enjoy writing about and then make sure you have several reliable sources to backup your writing,” she says.</p>\n<p>SusunW adds that you don’t necessarily need to start with a full biography. “If there do not appear to be sufficient sources to add a standalone biography on a woman, she can be added to events she participated in and organizations she was involved with, provided reliable sourcing can confirm her activities.”</p>\n<p>For example, if a woman participated in an academic conference, adding her name to the list of participants—with proper sourcing—may help someone write a biography about her at a later date.</p>\n<p>And Stephenson-Goodnight says you can always update an existing article. “Add a reference, add an internal link to another article, fix the punctuation, or improve the opening paragraph,” she says.</p>\n<h3>If you need help</h3>\n<p>Don’t be overwhelmed if you start to edit and find yourself confused. There are many ways to get help! You can post on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Women_in_Red\">talk page of  Women in Red</a>, as well as the talk pages for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Rosiestep\">Rosie</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Megalibrarygirl\">Sue</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SusunW\">SusunW</a>. (A talk page is like a message board where people communicate about a topic or article.)</p>\n<p>“If you get stuck or have questions, remember that all of us were new once and others helped us, so we&#8217;re glad to respond to your questions,” says Stephenson-Goodnight. “You can also reach me via Twitter or Facebook or email.”</p>\n<p>And if you’d rather work with people in person, there are opportunities for that too.</p>\n<p>“If you live near a city which has a Wikimedia Affiliate (Chapter, Thematic Organization, or User Group), check in with them regarding their events schedule. There&#8217;s an international list available on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup\">this Meetup page</a>. Or ask us at Women in Red to assist you in the search,” says Stephenson-Goodnight.</p>\n<h3>Helping beyond editing</h3>\n<p>And one last thing: you don’t need to edit Wikipedia to meaningfully contribute to Women in Red. You can tweet or post about new articles on social media (including the handle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikiwomeninred\">@WikiWomenInRed</a>), help find archival material, or help access photos that are licensed properly.</p>\n<p>“Having people who are willing to reach out to individuals to secure a license for a picture to be used on Commons is very helpful,” says Barnum. “Others may have access to archives or books that are offline and can help provide access to other editors.”</p>\n<p>And your work—whether an edit, a tweet, or a photo—is meaningful, and makes a difference <em>on </em>Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>“We are making a difference, one article at a time, making for incremental corrections to the systemic bias depicted in the written canon,” says Stephenson-Goodknight. “I can&#8217;t imagine doing anything more worthwhile with my free time.”</p>\n<p><em>Interview by Melody Kramer, Senior Audience Development Manager, Communications</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n","published":"2018-10-18T17:00:39.000Z","author":"Melody Kramer","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/18/women-in-red-wikiproject/","feed":{"source":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/feed/","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org","name":"Wikimedia Foundation"}},{"title":"Wikipedia is a mirror of the world’s gender biases","content":"<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>This post ran in the </em>Los Angeles Times <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-maher-wikipedia-gender-bias-20181018-story.html\"><em>on 18 October 2018</em></a>.</p>\n<p>When Donna Strickland won the Nobel Prize this month, she became only the third woman in history to receive the award in physics. An optical physicist at the University of Waterloo, Strickland is brilliant, accomplished and inspiring. To use Wikipedia parlance, she is very clearly notable.</p>\n<p>Except that, somehow, she wasn’t. Despite her groundbreaking research on a method of generating laser beams with ultrashort pulses, Strickland did not have a Wikipedia page until shortly after her Nobel win.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more disconcerting, a volunteer Wikipedia editor had drafted a page about Strickland in March only to have it declined in May. The reason: There wasn’t enough coverage of Strickland’s work in independent secondary sources to establish her notability. Her achievements simply weren’t documented in enough news articles that Wikipedia editors could cite.</p>\n<p>Before Wikipedia points a finger that might rightly be pointed back at us, let me acknowledge that Wikipedia’s shortcomings are absolutely real. Our contributors are majority Western and mostly male, and these gatekeepers apply their own judgment and prejudices. As a result, Wikipedia has dozens of articles about battleships and not nearly enough on poetry. We’ve got comprehensive coverage on college football but significantly less on African marathoners.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Wikipedia is by design a living, breathing thing—a collection of knowledge that many sources, in aggregate, say is worth knowing. It is therefore a reflection of the world’s biases more than it is a cause of them.</p>\n<p>We are working to correct biases in Wikipedia’s coverage. For instance, in 2014, Wikipedia editors evaluated all the biographies on English Wikipedia and found that only about 15% of them were about women. To rectify the imbalance, groups of volunteers, including the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_scientists\">WikiProject Women Scientists</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red\">WikiProject Women in Red</a>, have been identifying women who should have pages and creating articles about them.</p>\n<p>Today, 17.82% of our biographies are about women. This near 3% jump may not sound like much, but it represents 86,182 new articles. That works out to 72 new articles a day, every single day, for the past three and a half years.</p>\n<p>But signs of bias pop up in different ways. A 2015 study found that, on English Wikipedia, the word “divorced” appears more than four times as often in biographies of women than in biographies of men. We don’t fully know why, but it’s likely a multitude of factors, including the widespread tendency throughout history to describe the lives of women through their relationships with men.</p>\n<p>Technology can help identify such problems. Wikipedia articles about health get close attention from our community of medical editors, but for years, some articles on critical women’s health issues, such as breastfeeding, languished under a “low importance” categorization. An algorithm identified this mistake.</p>\n<p>But there is only so much Wikipedia itself can do. To fix Wikipedia’s gender imbalance, we need our contributors and editors to pay more attention to the accomplishments of women. This is true across all under-represented groups: people of color, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people, indigenous communities.</p>\n<p>Although we don’t believe that only women editors should write pages about other women, or writers of color about people of color, we do think that a broader base of contributors and editors—one that included more women and people of color, among others—would naturally help broaden our content.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia is founded on the concept that every individual should be able to share freely in the sum of all knowledge. We believe in “knowledge equity,” <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Direction\">which we define</a> as as the idea that diverse forms of knowledge should be recognized and respected. Wikipedia is not limited to what fits into a set of encyclopedias.</p>\n<p>We also need other fields to identify and document diverse talent. If journalists, book publishers, scientific researchers, curators, academics, grant-makers and prize-awarding committees don’t recognize the work of women, Wikipedia’s editors have little foundation on which to build.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, Wikipedia’s content and any biases therein have ramifications well beyond our own website. For instance, Wikipedia is now relied upon as a major source in the training of powerful artificial intelligence models, including models that underlie common technologies we all use.</p>\n<p>In such training processes, computers ingest large data sets, draw inferences from patterns in the data and then generate predictions. As is well understood in the programming world, bad or incomplete data generate biased outcomes. This phenomenon is known by the acronym GIGO: garbage in, garbage out.</p>\n<p>People may intuitively understand that Wikipedia is a perennial work in progress. Computers, on the other hand, simply process the data they’re given. If women account for only 17.82% of the data, we may find ourselves with software that thinks women are only 17.82% of what matters in the world.</p>\n<p>It is true that Wikipedia has a problem if Donna Strickland, an accomplished physicist, is considered worthy of a page only when she receives the highest possible recognition in her field. But this problem reflects a far more consequential and intractable problem in the real world.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia would like to encourage other knowledge-generating institutions to join us in our efforts to balance this inequity. We may not be able to change how society values women, but we can change how women are seen, and ensure that they are seen to begin with. That’s a start.</p>\n<p><em>Katherine Maher, Executive Director</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Women_in_STEM_(Wikipedia_Year_of_Science).png\">Image adaptation</a> by Eryk Salvaggio/Wiki Education Foundation, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>;

What building blocks need to be in place to leverage mobile phone network data for real-time policy analysis, decision making and impact tracking? UN Global Pulse and the Digital Impact Alliance are excited to host a joint-session at the UN World Data Forum in Dubai to explore the operational aspects of using mobile phone network data as a public good. At the event, we are bringing various actors from government, UN Agencies, Mobile Network Operators and NGOs to share their research and on-the-ground experience of using mobile network data to inform decision making around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and for humanitarian action.</p>\n<p>With more than 5 billion people connected to mobile services in 2017 and projections of reaching 5.9 billion by 2025, or 71 per cent of the world’s population, the mobile phone sector has become increasingly important in helping achieve the SDGs. While the mobile industry has made great strides in supporting the SDGs, we are still far from realizing its full impact. A critical piece of the mobile industry’s impact lies in the data it generates for analysis, which governments, humanitarian and development organizations, and donors agree would be extremely beneficial to address key humanitarian issues and reach the SDGs by 2030.</p>\n<p>Anonymised mobile network data contains information about population characteristics such as movements, density, location, social patterns, and finances. As this data is uniquely detailed and tractable, it can capture information not easily found from other sources at a scale that would be difficult to recreate through other means. Once anonymized and aggregated to appropriate levels, this data can provide a variety of insights with tremendous value for development partners, including but not limited to mobility, social interaction, and economic activity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.unglobalpulse.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UN Global Pulse</a> has developed a series of proof-of-concepts for the use of mobile network data for public good, including tracking food security, informing disaster management and understanding seasonal migration, among others. We’re working not only with mobile operators around the world, but also with their industry trade organization, the GSMA. In 2017, GSMA established an explicit strategy around putting anonymiszed mobile big data to work for the public good. There are currently 19 mobile operators who are committed to the Big Data for Social Good initiative. This is exciting for us because it shows how data philanthropy could work at an industry-wide scale, rather than with just one partner at a time.</p>\n<p>We also strive to catalyse the use of big data for public policy and humanitarian action by advancing normative frameworks and delivering learning experiences for policy makers across the world via our network of labs. At the World Data Forum, we hope to showcase some of our work in the South Pacific with Digicel and the Governments of Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, informing responses to natural disasters in these contexts and shaping our thinking on how to scale this work, as well as share the experiences of our colleagues at ITU who are using mobile network data to better understand the development of information societies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/what-we-do/data-for-development-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DIAL’s Data for Development</a> portfolio focuses on unlocking the value of private sector data (including mobile network data) in a safe, standardized manner, utilizing technical, commercial and governance-driven innovation to help achieve impact and sustainability. DIAL is working with a global network of partners including country governments, mobile network operators, technology solutions providers, donors and implementation organizations to support the building and scaling of data-driven solutions to meet the SDGs. DIAL also provides capital and operational support for development and deployment of reusable digital building blocks (e.g. software platforms, data analytics tools) that are designed once but that can be tailored to fit unique sectoral and geographical needs. This October, DIAL will share updates and key learnings from our work in Uganda and Malawi, our platform investments, and from global research by inviting our key partners to share their experiences. While each of these projects has been different in terms of focus and lessons learnt, we’ve also identified high-level synthesis items at the ecosystem level, which are helping us understand what is needed to bring the use of mobile data to scale.</p>\n<p>UNGP and DIAL are excited to co-host this panel given the overlap of our work and the recognition that in order to scale and sustain the use of mobile network data, we must share what we’ve learned so far and increase collaborative efforts. The UN World Data Forum provides a great opportunity to elevate the conversation so that we, as a data community, can work together to make the use of mobile network data more systemic and sustainable.</p>\n<p>We hope you join our session and bring forth your ideas so that we can further develop practices and models that safely and responsibly use mobile data for public good.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RobertKirkpatrick.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-17247 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RobertKirkpatrick-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RobertKirkpatrick-150x150.jpg 150w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RobertKirkpatrick-50x50.jpg 50w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RobertKirkpatrick-100x100.jpg 100w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RobertKirkpatrick.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a></em></p>\n<p><em>Robert Kirkpatrick is Director of UN Global Pulse, an innovation initiative of the UN Secretary-General on big data.

It goes something like this:</p>\n<p>Five years ago, four friends—Siân Evans, Jacqueline Mabey, Michael Mandiberg, and Laurel Ptak—gathered together to discuss an idea for promoting Wikipedia as a place to challenge one of the ways women are silenced: through the preservation of information. That discussion became the Art+Feminism campaign.</p>\n<p>Our goals today still revolve around combating gender inequity on the internet, using Wikipedia as a tool for correcting the written record on cis and trans women. And in the last year, all of us—from the leadership collective to the thousands of organizers, artists, librarians, activists, and editors who make up our global Art+Feminism community—have experienced many lessons, challenges, and triumphs.</p>\n<p>Take the month of March, for example. Over 4,000 people at more than 315 Art+Feminism events around the world came together to create or improve nearly 22,000 pages on Wikipedia, with a total of 43,000 content pages created or improved! That’s <em>four</em> times the output of our 2017 events. Four times. Out of 357 initiatives across 80 countries, we were named as 1 of 5 finalists in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/equals/status/1041695010339606528\">#EQUALSinTech</a> Leadership Award Category.</p>\n<p>Our fifth-annual <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/3941\">Wikipedia edit-a-thon at the Museum of Modern Art</a>, an all-day event designed to generate coverage of feminism and the arts on Wikipedia, took place on 3 March 2018 with hundreds of partner events around the world. It featured tutorials for the beginner Wikipedian, ongoing editing support, training on combating implicit and explicit biases, reference materials, childcare, and refreshments, with the leading panel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHcd1lfZ4ws\">“Careful with Each Other, Dangerous Together,”</a> about the relationship between structures of inequality on the internet, the emotional labor of internet activism, and creating inclusive online communities with Caroline Sinders, Sydette Harry, Salome Asega, and Sarah Jaffe.</p>\n<p>Art+Feminism’s regional organizers continue to amplify the way the project resonates with and reaches people all over the world. This year, <a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/04/05/tentaciones/1522922021_036290.html\">we focused on Latin America</a>, where Melissa Tamani has done concentrated outreach, quadrupling the number of events in that region compared to last year.  These nearly 30 events stretched from Laboratorio Cultural del Norte, Chihuahua, Mexico, to the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de Santiago.</p>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\" id=\"attachment_59270\"><div class=\"img-in-text\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-59270\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ArtAndFeminism-MoMA18-14-Panel.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></div><div class=\"img-caption\"><span class=\"photo-caption\">Panel discussion about Art+Feminism at The Museum of Modern Art, New York City, 3 March 2018.</span> <span class=\"photo-credit\"></span></div></div>\n<p>Our success is because of the commitment that we share with hundreds of organizers around the world to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/15/wikipedia-edit-a-thon-women-arts\">the voices of cis and trans women made visible</a> and their achievements shared just as widely as their male identified peers. We want to see justice done and each year,  we work to refine our strategies, our organizing, and our materials so that they are made even more accessible than the year before. With that goal in mind, we launched our <em><a href=\"http://www.artandfeminism.org/organizing-kit/\">Quick Guide for Organizers</a></em> and our <em><a href=\"http://www.artandfeminism.org/editing-kit/\">Quick Guide for (New) Editors</a></em>. Both guides have been made available on our training materials page in English and Spanish. On 30 September of this year, we are launching our redesigned training guides for organizers in PPT form in English and Spanish with more guides to follow translated into French and at least one African language with the goal of translating our materials for new editors and organizers into at least five additional languages in the next three years of our campaign. In addition to content focused on quick tips for organizing edit-a-thons and editing Wikipedia for the first time; we’ll be launching even more materials in the future focused specifically on advancing gender justice on the internet, designing brave/safe space policies through a lens knowledge equity and anti-harassment, and more.</p>\n<p>Beginning this project, we knew that our role would not only be to empower cis and trans women to edit online but to stand with them as they are challenged by those who do not see value in their perspective nor value in them. Art+Feminism is about making Wikipedia a more complete and representative source of information, but it doesn’t end there for us. It’s about dismantling systems of thought that diminish or erase entirely the place marginalized people and their communities have in our history.</p>\n<p>As we have addressed many glaring omissions about women on Wikipedia, we have seen our focus turn towards improving existing articles: for example, the first year we created 101 new articles, and improved roughly the same number, while this year we improved 7 times as many articles as we created.</p>\n<p>Our task is to take what we’ve made to the next level. From there, our task is to leverage the reach and impact of our social justice community to recognize that Wikipedia is just one of many tools that can be used to combat gender inequity and biased, informative content on the internet. We have so much to do, and we’re ready to take on the task of continuing to iterate and improve as our campaign evolves and adapts as it needs to.</p>\n<p>Look at what we’ve done—and there&#8217;s even more to come.</p>\n<p><em>McKensie Mack, Director<br />\nArt+Feminism</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em>We couldn’t do this work without our supporters, our partners, and our Regional Ambassadors: AfroCROWD; Black Lunch Table; Women in Red; the Professional Organization for Women in the Arts (POWarts); and The Museum of Modern Art.

Why were <em>Another One Bites the Dust</em> and <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> different?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, <em>Another One Bites the Dust</em> had more covers than the number of artists who have covered the song. This happens because some artists have covered the song twice (e.g. once on a studio release and another on a live recording release). On the other hand, Bohemian Rhapsody had more artists covering it than number of covers because some recordings featured multiple artists on the same cover (e.g. the 1992 live performance with Elton John and Axl Rose).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe data opens many interesting questions. Why have some songs persisted longer than others (in terms of recent covers)? Have these songs impacted culture and society in different ways? How have they permeated culture? Is there geographical bias in the data?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis exercise was an exploratory assignment, but we had fun visualizing it and ended up learning an interesting pattern in music data.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Check out the presentation and paper</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you&#8217;re interested for the full details, the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sMgwgo5dxi2n0j1elnlfZgk3OU5QnwsZfcrNwQYmmCQ/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">slides</a> and a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sLXBK2uUCpBazBUe_EiRdHOGlKUcBMwP7CG1XX9-Aiw/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">short paper</a> about the presentation are available online.

Over the past two months, the Developer Advocacy team at the Wikimedia Foundation collaborated with two open source initiatives: Mozilla’s <a href=\"https://opensource.mozilla.community/\">Open Source Student Network (OSSN)</a> and TeachingOpenSource.org&#8217;s <a href=\"http://foss2serve.org/index.php/POSSE\">Professors&#8217; Open Source Software Experience</a>  (TOS and POSSE, respectively). OSSN is designed to bring more students into open source projects, while POSSE aims to provide more professional development resources for professors.</p>\n<p>Mozilla&#8217;s pilot project, which is currently underway at colleges in the United States and Canada, aims to help university students find suitable open source projects to engage with. Before its launch, Mozilla researched the state of open source on college campuses, as well as criteria that students might consider in choosing a project. Based on this research, Mozilla developed <a href=\"https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/cracking-the-code-how-mozilla-is-helping-university-students-contribute-to-open-source-25fa630d8c5c\">an overview template for project selection</a> that presents the four most relevant (and often not properly surfaced) criteria at a glance: the mission of the project, technology, time needed for setting up the development environment, and how to connect with the community.</p>\n<p>POSSE, meanwhile, provides professional development experience to professors interested in teaching open source through Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) projects. POSSE began as an outreach effort by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat\">Red Hat</a> to the higher education community.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, our team, met with the contributors to the Mozilla’s Open Source Student Network (OSSN) and POSSE initiative at the <a href=\"https://libreplanet.org/2018/\">LibrePlanet conference</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We saw an opportunity to further support student contributors on the Wikimedia projects by collaborating with these two initiatives.</p>\n<p>There are two primary reasons why we are excited about this collaboration.</p>\n<p>First, we have received quite a lot of requests from professors or students interested in teaching open source in academia through Wikimedia projects. We get asked how to assess projects and incorporate them into semester-long coursework. We’ve always wondered how to help them best.</p>\n<p>In the past, we have partnered directly with university faculty to help shape projects for their students, which are both educational for them and beneficial for us. For example, last spring we worked with graduate students and faculty in <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Technical_Document_Re-working_Group/Technical_Communication_Outreach_and_Events#Technical_Communication_Collaboration,_Spring_2018:_BSU_&amp;_Cloud_Services_Technical_Documentation_Audit_and_Recommendations\">Boise State University’s Technical Writing program to audit and evaluate technical documentation for our Cloud Services team.</a>  The students were able to advise a real world client (our team), and we used their valuable recommendations to inform our approach. We would love to be able to provide focused support like this to everyone who asks. We are often able to  provide a <a href=\"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T169709\">project showcase and developer support</a> help, but we find we also have to defer many requests.</p>\n<p>Second, in our <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/New_Developers/Quarterly#Summary_of_key_findings\">year-long research study with 61 new developers to Wikimedia projects</a>, we learned that most new developers who we attract are working professionals. However, students get onboarded through our targeted outreach efforts via mentoring programs such as Google Summer of Code, Outreachy, Google Code-in and mentoring programs at hackathons.</p>\n<p>On the whole, this also ties into our <a href=\"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T199001\">bigger goal of collaborating with other FOSS communities</a> for engaging technical contributors.</p>\n<p>This collaboration with both the initiatives in its initial state is quite straight-forward and not quite resource intensive! We&#8217;ve proposed five <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/New_Developers\">newcomer-friendly projects</a> to be listed in the OSSN&#8217;s directory of projects: <a href=\"https://projects.ossn.club/\">https://projects.ossn.club/</a>. The project and mentor names are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES\">ORES</a>, Aaron Halfaker</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Newsletter\">Extension:Newsletter</a>, Tony Thomas</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Huggle\">Huggle</a>, Petr Bena</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/\">WikiEdu Dashboard</a>, Sage Ross</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Kiwix\">Kiwix</a>, Emmanuel Engelhart and Stephane Coillet-Matillon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Joining forces with Wikimedia for findings more effective ways to support University students while they are trying to contribute code to Open Source Projects is exciting! Students are looking to contribute to projects that are simple, diverse and have an impact; which is precisely what Wikimedia projects offer. I appreciate the time effort the project maintainers are putting aside for onboarding and supporting new contributors and looking forward to working with them.” &#8211; <a href=\"https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/bacharakis/\">Christos Bacharakis</a>, Mozilla Open Source Student Network &#8211; Program Manager</p>\n<p>For POSSE, we are now <a href=\"http://foss2serve.org/index.php/HFOSS_Projects#Education\">listed</a> as an organization in their directory of HFOSS projects under the Education category. The link contains getting started instructions. When we are approached by students and professors, we are willing to offer help!</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to have the Wikimedia Foundation working with TOS to engage students in Wikimedia projects,&#8221; said <a href=\"http://teachingopensource.org/user/hislop/\">Gregory Hislop</a> of the TOS Coordinating Committee. &#8220;Today’s students have grown up using Wikipedia, and they are quite interested in learning about the technology and community behind the project. The educational goals of Wikimedia also provide an excellent introduction to computing for social good. We appreciate the Wikimedia Foundation’s leadership in providing opportunities for students.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With this collaboration, we are hoping to engage more university students in contributing to open source projects and support professors in their efforts of teaching open source through Wikimedia projects. We are looking forward to learning from the research findings that Mozilla will conduct post completion of the first pilot, which we could then leverage to improve some of our processes and workflows of supporting new developers. We would also be curious how professors use our projects to teach in a classroom setting, which we could then be shared with our collaborators in academia.</p>\n<p><em>Srishti Sethi, Developer Advocate, Technical Engagement</em><br />\n<em>Sarah Rodlund, Technical Writer, Technical Engagement</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n","published":"2018-10-12T17:00:44.000Z","author":"Srishti Sethi and Sarah Rodlund","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/12/wikimedia-foundation-collaboration-ossn-posse/","feed":{"source":"https://wikimediafoundation.org/feed/","link":"https://wikimediafoundation.org","name":"Wikimedia Foundation"}},{"title":"Community digest: Writing about Islam in Hebrew; GLAM activity kicks off in Indonesia; news in brief","content":"<h3>Writing about Islam in Hebrew: Dar AsSalam Editors</h3>\n<p>Last January, Wikimedia communities around the world <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/01/30/community-digest-wikipedia-day-17/\">celebrated Wikipedia’s seventeenth birthday</a>—and Wikimedia Israel joined in. Held at the IBM office in Tel Aviv, nearly 60 Wikimedians attended, including a group of Palestinian editors from the Dar AsSalam Islamic Center (meaning House of Peace) in Kafr Qara, Haifa district.</p>\n<p>During the event, the Dar As-Salam group expressed their interest in volunteering to edit the Hebrew Wikipedia&#8217;s pages about Islam as a means to share Islamic culture with the Hebrew Wikipedia reader. A resulting few months of collaboration between the Dar AsSalam group and the Hebrew Wikipedia community has resulted the creation of 60 new pages, in addition to 150 others improved.</p>\n<p>It all started when the Dar AsSalam group introduced themselves to the Hebrew Wikipedia community. They offered to improve the content about Islam, Islamic culture, history and theology on the Hebrew Wikipedia. In their conversations with veteran Hebrew Wikipedia editors, the group mentioned their need for support, and they got some from Avner Avandrovic, veteran Hebrew Wikipedian and a member of the training staff at Wikimedia Israel. Avandrovic traveled to Kafr Qara in March 2018 to lead a Wikipedia editing workshop. Moderated by Bekriah S. Mawasi, the Arabic Education coordinator at Wikimedia Israel, the meetings took place in Dar AsSalam center, located inside the Nour al-Haq mosque in Kafr Qara.</p>\n<p>Dar AsSalam center is an information center aiming at providing information about Islam to Muslims and to visitors from different backgrounds and religions. The main objective of the center is to print out and give away Islamic books promoting the values of tolerance, moderation, openness, modesty and spirituality. Understanding other religions, develops curiosity about Islam. Another goal is creating a space for mutual understanding between different cultures in Israel as a way to promote a shared life, peace and respect for each other&#8217;s culture. The center publishes books and pamphlets explaining Islam, in both Hebrew and Arabic, including translation of the meanings of the Holy Koran.</p>\n<p>The editing course at Dar AsSalam included three meetings. Twelve Arabic speaking participants participated in the workshops and edited content in Hebrew. In addition to learning technical skills and editing the Hebrew Wikipedia, editors were introduced to the norms and policies of the Hebrew Wikipedia community and were encouraged to participate in discussions. They also learned about encyclopedic writing on religious topics. The group showed proficient understanding and full collaboration, and by the third meeting in August, they had written over 60 new articles and edited more than 150 other ones. The articles were diverse in content, ranging from <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%97%D7%99%D7%90%D7%90_%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%90-%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9F\">books</a>, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%92%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%AA\">theology</a>, and profiles of distinguished religious and historical figures. The group created new categories too and the mentioned achievements were completed within one month. They look forward to continuing in the future.</p>\n<p>Members of Dar AsSalam made prolific contributions to the Hebrew Wikipedia with references in English and Hebrew. Wikimedia Israel appreciates the commitment the group showed to free knowledge. Five of the group members joined the celebrations of the 15th anniversary of Hebrew Wikipedia which took place in Tel Aviv on 10 August 2018. Such collaborations are great opportunities to share diverse opinions within the Wikipedia communities and enhances collaborative content writing in the largest knowledge base.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Bks-WMIL\">Bekriah S.

However, the artists and art communities are by far noted as the primary parties making considerable contributions within the Indonesian art world.</p>\n<p>Given this landscape, a new GLAM-Wiki project could make a major difference in people&#8217;s access to digital collections in the Indonesian GLAM sector.</p>\n<p>On 30 and 31 May, Wikimedia Indonesia, together with Indonesian Arts Coalition, arranged a visit to Dr. H.C. Oemboe Hina Kapita Museum in Waingapu, East Nusa Tenggara. The museum allowed us to digitize their collection, which ranged from ceramic plates, ritual ceremony equipment, a few of traditional percussions, and of course, Sumbanese’s proud: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikat#Weft_ikat\">Weft ikat</a>, traditional pattern textile.</p>\n<p>On the first day, we started a discussion with the participants about how museums can respond to the digital era by utilizing technology to engage with the public. It is as easy as maintaining the information through apps and social media or using multimedia. The audience included museum staff, art practitioners, indigenous people and officials from the Office of Culture, Tourism, Public Library and Archive.</p>\n<p>Most locals can afford smartphones and frequently go online on social media. Thus, it is merely a matter of first; the lack of references on various internet platforms, and second; the lack of awareness about the internet. We are looking forward to doing some outreach work introducing Wikimedia Commons and Creative Commons licenses, in which they are embraced to be more active in sharing files which link to the local heritage they possess.</p>\n<p>On the second day we held a session for the participants to try their hands on Wikimedia Commons. We invited the museum staff members to guide the participants while they look around and pick the objects which represented local culture to be digitized, and this was the interesting part. The section where ceramic plates stored became our first destination. It was nice to see that at this phase both the staff and the audience starting to discuss the objects, which are believed to have a strong relationship with the Chinese trading, exchanging information to each other whilst enriching the story behind it. For instance, there was new information on one of the plates found inside the cemetery in an archaeological site.</p>\n<p>Over the two day event, we have successfully digitized and uploaded <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_from_Museum_Dr._(H.C)_Oemboe_Hina_Kapita\">18 images</a> to Wikimedia Commons, including short descriptions about the objects.</p>\n<p>“I could easily follow the instructions. There were no technical problems while working on Wikimedia Commons. I suppose we can do more to promote arts and culture in Sumba,” said Gusti Dida, a museum staff member who became a Wikimedia Commons contributor since then</p>\n<p>The Sumba Museum, as it also is called, is the only museum in Waingapu, West Sumba, where the island is sometimes visited by local and foreign tourists because of its beautiful savanna, horse riding culture, and famous colorful weft ikat. The museum once temporarily closed and reopened in 2016, yet the collections are not well maintained. We were lucky to be invited by the Secretary of the Office of Culture and Tourism to hold this first GLAM activity in a local museum in Indonesia.</p>\n<h4>Indonesian art and culture in the digital landscape</h4>\n<p>Geographical and governance factors are the biggest challenges we are facing in building a digital environment for the Indonesian art and culture. Based on that, Wikimedia Indonesia is seeking to collaborate with local cultural institutions to digitize their archives as well as persuaded them to be the contributors to all kinds of Wikimedia platforms. Majalah Horison, one of the oldest Indonesian literature magazine and Majalah Kajawen, the Javanese magazine during colonial times are examples of the digitization projects that running ahead.</p>\n<p>Now the museum staff of Dr. H.C Oemboe Hina Kapita Museum are able to produce and share knowledge by actively sharing their collection on Wikimedia Commons. At the end of the event, some participants were quite excited and offered the plan of making such follow-up activity in order to increase public attention towards the museum.</p>\n<p>Any contribution on Wikimedia projects related to Indonesian art and culture could be seen as ways to building wider network and existence on the Internet, emphasizing the local’s possession of their own culture, their own narratives that complement the interpretation by others.</p>\n<p><em>Annayu Maharani, Researcher, Indonesian Arts Coalition and member, Wikimedia Indonesia</em></p>\n<h3>In brief</h3>\n<div class=\"article-img img-in-text\">\n<div class=\"img-container mar-bottom\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-59212\" src=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Prize_and_Certificate_distribution_ceremony_at_Wiki_Awareness_Campaign_Karnal_13.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"background-color: #eeeeee;padding: 10px\"><strong>The Wikipedia Library names Shweta Yadav as their star coordinator for April to June:</strong> &#8220;In 2007 while still a school student, our teacher asked us not to prepare assignments using Wikipedia considering it a non-reliable source,” <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Shypoetess\">Shweta Yadav</a> recalls. This was the beginning of Shweta’s curiosity towards Wikipedia and to understanding how it worked. Shweta further explained that even 10 years after these instructions, she become a culprit of the same criticisms as she found herself offering the same advice to her students. In an attempt to do what was right and to clear her conscience in teaching her students the right way to use an encyclopedia, she first participated in a 100 Wikidays challenge. She was introduced to the campaign by a colleague who got her editing. Through these efforts she discovered her curiosity was justified as the instructions given to her may have not been quite accurate.</p>\n<p style=\"background-color: #eeeeee;padding: 10px\">Shweta gradually started outreach activities in Karnal to increase awareness amongst students and academics about her discovery, and her plight to completely detach the “unreliable tag” to Wikipedia led her to The Wikipedia Library Program (TWL). She volunteered to become the coordinator for the Hindi Branch. “As a researcher I knew how knowledgeable a well-referenced article could be and that the availability of resources will attract good editors and increase quality of content.&#8221; Her thoughts on how crucial well-referenced articles are to Wikipedia led her to the creation of the first branch in India, the Hindi TWL Branch.</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 10px\"><strong>Bengali Wikisource community releases three promotional videos</strong>: The Bengali Wikisource community has launched an awareness campaign about their project.

It always seems simple, but sometimes there are bumps along the way. The first activity I did to begin contributing to ListenBrainz was create my development environment. I wasn&#8217;t successful with the documentation in the README, so I had to play around and work with the project before I was even running it.</p>\n<p>The first part of this post details how to set up your own development environment. Then, the second half talks about the solution I came up with and my first contribution back to the project.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-6920\"></span></p>\n<h2>Install dependencies: Docker</h2>\n<p>This tutorial assumes you are using a Linux distribution. If you&#8217;re using a different operating system, install the necessary dependencies or packages with your preferred method.</p>\n<p>ListenBrainz ships in Docker containers, which helps create your development environment and later deploy the application. Therefore, to work on the project, you need to install Docker and use containers for building the project. Containers save you from installing all of this on your own workstation!</p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;m using Fedora, I run this command.</p>\n<pre>sudo dnf install docker docker-compose</pre>\n<h2>Register a MusicBrainz application</h2>\n<p>Next, you need to register your application and get a OAuth token from MusicBrainz. Using the OAuth token lets you sign into your development environment with your MusicBrainz account. Then, you can import your plays from somewhere else.</p>\n<p>To register, visit the <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/account/applications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MusicBrainz applications page</a>. There, look for the option to <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/account/applications/register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">register your application</a>. Fill out the form with these three options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Name</strong>: (any name you want and will recognize, I used <code>listenbrainz-server-devel</code>)</li>\n<li><strong>Type</strong>: <code>Web Application</code></li>\n<li><strong>Callback URL</strong>: <code><a href=\"http://localhost/login/musicbrainz/post\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://localhost/login/musicbrainz/post</a></code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After entering this information, you&#8217;ll have a OAuth client ID and OAuth client secret. You&#8217;ll use these for configuring ListenBrainz.</p>\n<h4>Update config.py</h4>\n<p>With your new client ID and secret, update the ListenBrainz configuration file. If this is your first time configuring ListenBrainz, copy the sample to a live configuration.</p>\n<pre>cp listenbrainz/config.py.sample listenbrainz/config.py</pre>\n<p>Next, open the file with your favorite text editor and look for this section.</p>\n<pre># MusicBrainz OAuth\r\nMUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_ID = \"CLIENT_ID\"\r\nMUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_SECRET = \"CLIENT_SECRET\"</pre>\n<p>Update the strings with your client ID and secret. After doing this, your ListenBrainz development environment is able to authenticate and log in from your MusicBrainz login.</p>\n<h2>Initialize ListenBrainz databases</h2>\n<p>Your development environment needs some databases present to work. Before proceeding, run these three commands to initialize the databases.</p>\n<pre>docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_db --create-db\r\ndocker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_msb_db --create-db\r\ndocker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_influx</pre>\n<p>Your development environment is now ready. Now, let&#8217;s actually see ListenBrainz load locally!</p>\n<h2>Run the magic script</h2>\n<p>Once you have done this, run the <code>develop.sh</code> script in the root of the repository. Using <code>docker-compose</code>, the script creates multiple Docker containers for the different services and parts of the ListenBrainz server. Running this script will start Redis, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and web server containers, to name a few. But this also makes it easy to stop them all later.</p>\n<pre>./develop.sh</pre>\n<p>You will see the containers build and eventually run. Leave the script running to see your development environment. Later, you can shut it down by pressing <code>CTRL^C</code>. Once everything is running, visit your new site from your browser!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://localhost/</a></p>\n<p>Now, you are all set to begin making changes and testing them in your development environment!</p>\n<h2>Making my first pull request</h2>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, my first attempt at a development environment was unsuccessful. My system kept denying permission to the processes in the containers. After looking at system audit logs and running a temporary <code>setenforce 0</code>, I tried the script one more time. Everything suddenly worked! So the issue was mostly with SELinux.</p>\n<p>With my goal to get my environment set up, I figured out a few issues with the configuration offered by the project developers. I eventually made <a href=\"https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/pull/257\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PR #257</a> against <code>listenbrainz-server</code> with my improvements.</p>\n<h4>Labeling SELinux volume mounts</h4>\n<p>To diagnose the issue, I started with a quick search and found a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24288616/permission-denied-on-accessing-host-directory-in-docker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StackOverflow question</a> with my same problem. There, the question was about Docker containers and denied permissions in the container. The answers explained it was an SELinux error and the context for the containers was not set. However, temporarily changing context for a directory didn&#8217;t seem too effective and doesn&#8217;t persist across reboots.</p>\n<p>Continuing the search, I found an issue filed against <code>docker-compose</code> about the <code>:z</code> and <code>:Z</code> flags for volume mounts. These flags set SELinux context for containers, with the best explanation I found coming from <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/35222815/2497452\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Two suffixes :z or :Z can be added to the volume mount. These suffixes tell Docker to relabel file objects on the shared volumes. The &#8216;z&#8217; option tells Docker that the volume content will be shared between containers. Docker will label the content with a shared content label. Shared volumes labels allow all containers to read/write content. The &#8216;Z&#8217; option tells Docker to label the content with a private unshared label.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, I added the <code>:z</code> flag to all the volume mounts in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. I submitted a fix upstream for this in <a href=\"https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/pull/257\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listenbrainz-server#257</a>!</p>\n<h4>Correct the startup port</h4>\n<p>In the README, it says the server will start on port 8000, but the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file actually started the server on port 80. I included a fix for this in <a href=\"https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/pull/257\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">my pull request</a> as well.</p>\n<h2>git push!</h2>\n<p>This post makes a debugging experience that actually took hours look like it happened in minutes. But after getting over this hurdle, it was awesome to finally see ListenBrainz running locally on my workstation. It was an even better feeling when I could take my improvements and send them back in a pull request to ListenBrainz. Hopefully this will make it easier for others to create their own development environments and start hacking!</p>\n","published":"2018-10-11T08:00:58.000Z","author":"Justin W.

The call to action builds upon a new Digital Investment Framework that DIAL and ITU have developed for global stakeholders which identifies digital technologies that are most important to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>\n<p class=\"responsiveNews\">The launch of this new SDG Digital Investment Framework is the first step in DIAL and ITU’s ongoing collaboration. The Framework examined use cases in agriculture, education and the health sector and identifies a set of common, reusable ICT building blocks. For example, a few of the building blocks relate to identification, messaging and payment systems, all which can be reused across multiple development sectors. Investing in reusable ICT building blocks – like India and Estonia have approached their e-governance efforts – has been proven to increase efficiency, deliver a higher ROI for governments and create a platform-based ecosystem that attracts a higher volume of application providers.</p>\n<p class=\"responsiveNews\">“The Framework reinforces our commitment to breaking down barriers and looking for ways to institutionalize digital technology into development services,” said Kate Wilson, CEO, Digital Impact Alliance. “While this is our first joint initiative with ITU, we look forward to our continued work to help governments, the private sector, and donors make smarter and more strategic investments in digital technology to realize their potential to deliver SDG services to anyone, anywhere, at any time.”</p>\n<p class=\"responsiveNews\">DIAL and ITU are inviting the development community to support a whole-of-government approach to deploying integrated digital services to achieve the SDGs. Whole-of-government refers to an approach whereby governments look across all sectors and organizations when considering how to invest in ICT infrastructure in an integrated and coordinated manner. Taking this holistic view helps countries realize economies of scale that are not possible when ICT is implemented in a piecemeal fashion. DIAL and ITU have proposed specific calls to action for governments, donors and technology implementers to use this approach and in return have outlined specific support the partners will provide to others.</p>\n<p class=\"responsiveNews\">“Information and communication technologies are a key platform for development and a powerful tool to help achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, says Brahima Sanou, Director of the ITU Telecommunication Development Bureau. “This Framework is an important tool to help policy makers and donors to identify and direct funds to more efficient and effective ICT investments that will ensure no one is left behind.”</p>\n<p class=\"responsiveNews\">The SDG commitments made by 193 countries were set to “transform our world” by 2030. Countries’ ability to achieve this goal is dependent on innovative uses of ICT services that can make existing programs more effective and scalable to better serve their population.</p>\n<p class=\"responsiveNews\">“Despite billions of dollars invested over the last decade to integrate programs and digital technology, the development community has yet to see software providers creating applications to support the SDGs because investments are often siloed by sector, address a very small target audience and are designed for the short term,” said Jonathan Payne, Senior Policy Advisor at DIAL. &#8220;The SDG Digital Investment Framework and whole-of-government approach address these issues by fostering reusable ICT building blocks that can be implemented across multiple sectors to meet diverse development needs.”</p>\n<p class=\"responsiveNews\">To read DIAL and ITU’s Call to Action, visit <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ITUDIAL\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/ITUDIAL</a></p>\n<p class=\"responsiveNews\">###</p>\n<p class=\"responsiveNews\">About the Digital Impact Alliance</p>\n<p class=\"responsiveNews\">The Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) aims to realize a more inclusive digital society in emerging markets, in which all women, men and children benefit from life-enhancing, mobile-based digital services.

My father was an IT worker, my mother a technology specialist, and my older sister has since dumped the fax (and boyfriend) and now works in Big Tech. While technology runs in my family and has impacted my life beyond fond memories, this past summer I joined another digitally-literate family, the <a href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/\">Digital Impact Alliance</a>, to help tech have a lasting impact on the lives of others. This post highlights how my experiences with digital development and peacetech underscore why I believe in DIAL’s mission.</p>\n<p>I cut my teeth in digital development in 2011, when I helped build and manage an online course for advanced mediation skills during my <a href=\"https://davidomckaycenter.com/#mckay-center\">undergraduate peacebuilding program</a>. During a mediation role-play with some students based in Fiji, who had experienced two coups d&#8217;état in the previous decade, I was struck by the role technology was playing in delivering critical services to underserved populations. Years later as <a href=\"https://www.peacecorps.gov/morocco/\">Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco</a>, I led an monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) task force to utilize higher rates of mobile devices in the field (85 percent from 57 percent in the previous cohort) to test mobile data collection methods and hold program-wide conversations about improving cultures of accountability and learning.</p>\n<p>I eventually connected with <a href=\"https://howtobuildup.org/\">Build Up</a>, a social enterprise that convenes peacebuilders, technologists, and artists, and works on <a href=\"https://www.stabilityjournal.org/articles/10.5334/sta.cv/\">peacetech</a> related initiatives. Aside from volunteering and presenting at their annual <a href=\"https://howtobuildpeace.org/\">Build Peace </a>conferences over the years, I recently worked on two peacetech projects: a <a href=\"https://peacehack.io/2017/09/12/peacehackldn2017-robotsforpeace/\">#peacehack</a> where participants built Twitter bots to amplify the message of International Peace Day and a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@howtobuildup/building-the-commons-dc60e6ee7b69\">campaign</a> following the 2016 US presidential election that utilized Twitter bots and social network analysis to address political polarization, burst filter bubbles, and bring people together for virtual dialogue about polarizing issues.</p>\n<p>Throughout all these experiences, despite the number of bots, mobile devices, or automated learning modules, I found technology and program designs were only as good as the people and values behind them. As it turns out, there is evidence to back this up. My love-letter-faxing sister, <a href=\"http://jenniferbrook.com/\">Jennifer Brook</a>, is still using tech to make connections, just as a Design Researcher for Dropbox. I recently read one of her <a href=\"https://content.yudu.com/web/16f77/0A432f8/SchoolOfLife2017/html/index.html?page=80&amp;origin=reader\">reports</a> where her research team uncovered a key characteristic of successful, tech-enabled teams is an explicit <a href=\"http://jenniferbrook.com/work/prototyping-peace\">social contract</a>, or an articulation of what values inform their approach and how they work together.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, DIAL is one of the biggest proponents of social contracts in the digital development space. As steward of the <a href=\"https://digitalprinciples.org\">Principles for Digital Development</a>, DIAL advocates for ecosystem actors to recognize, commit to, and become <a href=\"https://digitalprinciples.org/endorse/endorsers/\">signatories</a> of generally accepted standards of technology for development. Internally, DIAL not only practices the Digital Principles, but has developed an organizational social contract, what we call our Values Agreement, to inform and evaluate our work. From business operations meetings, decisions about future investments, strategy discussions, design and work planning, even down to program-specific monitoring, evaluation, and learning plans, DIAL team-members strive to highlight and work by the values we’ve articulated and signed onto.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16807 size-full\" src=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"1908\" srcset=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1.jpg 4032w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1-300x142.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1-768x363.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1-1024x485.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px\" /></a>These conversations are not always easy, but having an explicit values agreement gives us a north-star to guide us though this challenging work. In an era of unintended consequences in official development assistance, social contracts like the Digital Principles and internal value agreements help DIAL and other ecosystem partners ethically and intentionally realize the vision of a world in which the underserved benefit from digital technology.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in learning more, you can email me at <a href=\"mailto:ztilton@digitalimpactalliance.org\">ztilton@digitalimpactalliance.org</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DIAL_community\">Twitter</a> for updates about our work.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/staff-spotlight-zach-tilton-on-technologys-impact-on-peace-and-development/\">Staff Spotlight: Zach Tilton on Technology’s Impact on Peace and Development</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org\">DIAL</a>.</p>\n","published":"2018-09-21T20:38:09.000Z","author":"Blog Moderator","link":"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/staff-spotlight-zach-tilton-on-technologys-impact-on-peace-and-development/","feed":{"source":"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/feed/","link":"https://digitalimpactalliance.org","name":"DIAL"}},{"title":"GSoC 2018 : Building a design system. Journey and learnings..","content":"<p>Hello,<br />\nI am Chhavi. I have mostly been helping around with all things design in MetaBrainz. I recently graduated from IIT Guwahati, India and started contributing to MusicBrainz after attending the summit last year, around the same time.</p>\n<p>As a Google Summer of Code student, my project was to <a href=\"https://community.metabrainz.org/t/gsoc-2018-react-based-ui-component-library/364623\">build a design system</a> with React UI components for the upcoming overhaul of MusicBrainz&#8217;s website. It surely was a really interesting journey, right from when I heard about the community and I would like to share some snippets of it with you!</p>\n<p><strong>May 2017:</strong> I hear about Picard, and how a bunch of really cool people who meet online are building it. I was intrigued.</p>\n<p><strong>Around August 2017:</strong> I pop in the <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Communication/IRC\">IRC channel</a> #metabrainz, and after much overthinking, I drop a &#8220;Hi&#8221;. Followed was a really warm welcome by people I will soon call friends and a lot of developer-y jargon I had no clue about.</p>\n<p><strong>September 2017:</strong> I attend the annual <a href=\"https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2017/11/03/metabrainz-summit-17/\">MusicBrainz developer summit</a> in Barcelona. And boy oh boy, I am now part of the family. Over the few days there, I have immense fun interacting and learning from the community.</p>\n<p><strong>November 2017:</strong> We set up our <a href=\"https://tickets.metabrainz.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5&amp;view=detail&amp;selectedIssue=MBS-9652\">JIRA ticket system</a> for design issues and start working on the mockups for the redesign. The entire community comes together on JIRA tickets and Discourse posts to talk about where we want to go with this overhaul.</p>\n<p><strong>January 2018:</strong> Community members encourage me to try my hand at front-end development. One is really lucky to find people, who encourage you to grow out of your comfort zone and help you cross that wall. In MetaBrainz, there is no shortage of such kind of people.</p>\n<p><strong>March 2018:</strong> With little confidence and lots of hopes, I apply for the Google Summer of Code programme. I start learning the ropes of development, with help of online tutorials and obviously our community. We also met for a <a href=\"https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2018/03/26/delhi-mini-summit-2018/\">mini-summit in Delhi</a> to discuss ListenBrainz and spicy food.</p>\n<p><strong>April 2018:</strong> Hence began my full-fledged journey of learning and spending a summer of coding. It wasn&#8217;t easy, but I learned a lot in the process.</p>\n<p>We set up the initial design system using react-bootstrap and react-storybook. I then started importing UI components into the system, followed by its documentation. I wrote up a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/chhavijustme/8feddbe5016365e2d6757a3605607fb9\">more detailed description of the process</a> too.</p>\n<p><strong>August 2018:</strong> As of now, we have the <a href=\"https://github.com/metabrainz/design-system\">design system</a> in place. The future plan is to continue adding components to it as well focus on having well thought contributing guidelines. I will also continue working on designing the mockups for the user interface for various entities.</p>\n<p>Google Summer of Code was just another milestone in my journey with MetaBrainz. My time here has been a time of both personal and professional growth. I now feel more comfortable in a development environment, the ongoing chats on IRC make more sense to me and I feel less inhibited to put my thoughts out there. I completed my college, moved cities, traveled… all while having a set of these amazing people I call family.</p>\n<p>A special shout out to Rob for keeping me going, bitmap for being ever so patient and understanding, samj1912 for introducing me to MetaBrainz, CatQuest, iliekcomputers, Suyash, Freso, reo and zas for being amazing friends through it all.</p>\n<p>The thing I like about our community is, we had seasoned developers as well as newbies like me, all together working together to create amazing stuff. Hoping to continue being an involved and colorful part of this community,</p>\n<p>You will obviously keep hearing from me in the coming days,<br />\nChhavi</p>\n","published":"2018-09-19T08:00:10.000Z","author":"Chhavi","link":"https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2018/09/19/gsoc-2018-building-a-design-system-journey-and-learnings/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.musicbrainz.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.musicbrainz.org","name":"MusicBrainz/MetaBrainz Blog"}},{"title":"Google Code-in: el Liquid Galaxy LAB del Parc Científic aconsegueix de nou la confiança de Google - Català","content":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

The server supports sending and receiving of data only in JSONAPI spec, so, we needed to serialize java models into JSON objects and deserialize JSON data into java models following JSONAPI spec. To achieve this we followed the following steps.</p>\n<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>\n<p>We will be using <a href=\"https://github.com/jasminb/jsonapi-converter\">jasminb/jsonapi-converter</a> which handles request/response parsing of models following JSONAPI Spec and Retrofit plugin of <a href=\"https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/jackson\">jackson converter</a> to serializing JSON to Java Models and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Let’s create a java model. We are using some annotations provided by <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/\">Lombok</a> library to avoid writing boilerplate code. @JsonNaming annotation is used to apply KebabCaseStrategy while serializing fields</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Data<br />\n@Type(&#8220;order&#8221;)<br />\n@AllArgsConstructor<br />\n@JsonNaming(PropertyNamingStrategy.KebabCaseStrategy.class)<br />\n@Table(database = OrgaDatabase.class, allFields = true)<br />\npublic class Order {</p>\n<p>@PrimaryKey<br />\n@Id(LongIdHandler.class)<br />\npublic Long id;</p>\n<p>public float amount;<br />\npublic String completedAt;<br />\npublic String identifier;<br />\npublic String paidVia;<br />\npublic String paymentMode;<br />\npublic String status;</p>\n<p>@Relationship(&#8220;event&#8221;)<br />\n@ForeignKey(stubbedRelationship = true, onDelete = ForeignKeyAction.CASCADE)<br />\npublic Event event;</p>\n<p>public Order() { }<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the NetworkModule class, there is a method providesMappedClasses() containing a list of classes that needs to be serialized/deserialized. We need to add the above model in the list. Then, this list is provided to Singleton instance of JSONAPIConvertorFactory through Dagger. JSONAPIConvertorFactory uses the Retrofit ObjectMapper and maps the classes that are handled by this instance.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Provides<br />\nClass[] providesMappedClasses() {<br />\nreturn new Class[]{Event.class, Attendee.class, Ticket.class, Order.class};<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Further, various serialization properties can be used while building Singleton ObjectMapper instance. Adding any properties here ensures that these are applied to all the mapped classes by JSONAPIConvertorFactory. For eg, we are using the serialization property to throw an exception and fail whenever empty beans are encountered.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Provides<br />\n@Singleton<br />\nObjectMapper providesObjectMapper() {<br />\nreturn new ObjectMapper()<br />\n.disable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES)<br />\n.disable(SerializationFeature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS)<br />\n// Handle constant breaking changes in API by not including null fields<br />\n// TODO: Remove when API stabilizes and/or need to include null values is there<br />\n.setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT);<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Github Repository for jsonapi-converter <a href=\"https://github.com/jasminb/jsonapi-converter\">https://github.com/jasminb/jsonapi-converter</a></li>\n<li>Github repository for Jackson Retrofit Plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/jackson\">https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/jackson</a></li>\n<li>Official Website for Project Lombok <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/\">https://projectlombok.org/</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Github Repository for Open-Event-Orga-App <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app</a></p>\n","published":"2018-08-26T14:28:30.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/serializing-java-objects-for-rest-api-requests-in-open-event-organizer-app/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Adding Preference Settings using Preference Fragment Compat","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment-768x568.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?resize=768%2C568&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?resize=271%2C200&amp;ssl=1 271w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?resize=750%2C554&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?resize=1024%2C757&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?w=1354&amp;ssl=1 1354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17568\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/adding-preference-settings-using-preference-fragment-compat/preference-fragment/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?fit=1354%2C1001&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1354,1001\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"preference fragment\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?fit=750%2C554&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preference-fragment.png?fit=1024%2C757&amp;ssl=1\" /><p>It is very much likely that one needs to add preferences to their app which span the entire application and therefore can be accessed anywhere in the app without storing anything in database or making global variables. For an instance, in <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">Open Event Organizer App</a> we added the preferences to store the privacy policy, cookie policy etc. The user can access these items in Settings Preference which in device settings. In this blog post we will see how to add preference settings to the app by storing the data in shared preferences.</p>\n<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>\n<p>The benefit of storing the data in shared preference and not in local storage is that the access time for the data is drastically reduced and the data persists even when the app is closed. We will use <a href=\"https://github.com/Gericop/Android-Support-Preference-V7-Fix\">this library</a> which is built on top of official preference-v7 library.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we will make a preference resource layout file and add the preference for privacy policy and cookie policy in the preference screen.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&lt;PreferenceScreen xmlns:android=&#8221;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&#8221;&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;Preference<br />\nandroid:key=&#8221;@string/privacy_policy_key&#8221;<br />\nandroid:title=&#8221;@string/privacy_policy&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;Preference<br />\nandroid:key=&#8221;@string/cookie_policy_key&#8221;<br />\nandroid:title=&#8221;@string/cookie_policy&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;/PreferenceScreen&gt;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Make a separate preference fragment class named LegalPreferenceFragment which extends PreferenceFragmentCompat. Then we will override onCreatePreferenceFix() method.</p>\n<p>Inside this, we will create an instance of Preference Manager and set shared preference name for it and set the preference using the layout file. This enables us to use findPreference() method to retrieve the layout preferences by their key. After, retrieving the preference we will set onClick listener to launch activity with an intent to open browser for the url passed in data bundle.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Override<br />\npublic void onCreatePreferencesFix(@Nullable Bundle bundle, String rootKey) {<br />\nPreferenceManager manager = getPreferenceManager();<br />\nmanager.setSharedPreferencesName(Constants.FOSS_PREFS);</p>\n<p>setPreferencesFromResource(R.xml.legal_preferences, rootKey);</p>\n<p>findPreference(getString(R.string.privacy_policy_key)).setOnPreferenceClickListener(preference -&gt; {<br />\nBrowserUtils.launchUrl(getContext(), PRIVACY_POLICY_URL);<br />\nreturn true;<br />\n});<br />\nfindPreference(getString(R.string.cookie_policy_key)).setOnPreferenceClickListener(preference -&gt; {<br />\nBrowserUtils.launchUrl(getContext(), COOKIE_POLICY_URL);<br />\nreturn true;<br />\n});<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><b>References</b></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Preference Fragment Compat library by Takisoft <a href=\"https://github.com/Gericop/Android-Support-Preference-V7-Fix\">https://github.com/Gericop/Android-Support-Preference-V7-Fix</a></li>\n<li>Android Preference Documentation <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/preference/PreferenceGroup\">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/preference/PreferenceGroup</a></li>\n</ol>\n","published":"2018-08-26T11:20:26.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/adding-preference-settings-using-preference-fragment-compat/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Implementing Timeline for Attendees Activity in Organizer App","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"545\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/checkin_history-768x545.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/checkin_history.png?resize=768%2C545&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/checkin_history.png?resize=282%2C200&amp;ssl=1 282w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/checkin_history.png?resize=750%2C532&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/checkin_history.png?resize=1024%2C727&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/checkin_history.png?w=1408&amp;ssl=1 1408w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17565\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/implementing-timeline-for-attendees-activity-in-organizer-app/checkin_history/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/checkin_history.png?fit=1408%2C999&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1408,999\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"checkin_history\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/checkin_history.png?fit=750%2C532&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/checkin_history.png?fit=1024%2C727&amp;ssl=1\" /><p><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">Open Event Organizer App </a>offers the functionality to Checkin/checkout attendees but the Organizer was unable to view when a particular attendee was checkin or checkout.

In <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">Open Event Orga App</a>, the Organizer had a choice to switch between viewing Net Sales or Gross Sales in the App’s Dashboard. We decided to use a preference list to allow the user to select between using Net or Gross Sales.</p>\n<p>The benefit of using Preference List and not any other storage media (like SQLite) to store the information is that, Preference List stores the information as key-value pair in SharedPreferences which makes it easy to store and extract small amount of data with strong consistency guarantees and using less time. Let’s move on to the implementation.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>Firstly add the dependency in build.gradle.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>implementation &#8220;com.takisoft.fix:preference-v7:27.1.0.0&#8221;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the preferences layout file, we will use checkboxes.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&lt;PreferenceScreen xmlns:android=&#8221;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&#8221;&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;CheckBoxPreference<br />\nandroid:key=&#8221;@string/gross_sales_key&#8221;<br />\nandroid:title=&#8221;@string/gross_sales&#8221;<br />\nandroid:defaultValue=&#8221;true&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;CheckBoxPreference<br />\nandroid:key=&#8221;@string/net_sales_key&#8221;<br />\nandroid:title=&#8221;@string/net_sales&#8221;<br />\nandroid:defaultValue=&#8221;false&#8221; /&gt;<br />\n&lt;/PreferenceScreen&gt;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We will create SalesDataSettings class which extends PreferenceFragmentCompat and override onCreatePreferenceFix method. We will request PreferenceManager and set SharedPreferencesName. The manager will be used to store and retrieve key-value pairs from SharedPreferences. Using setPreferencesFromResource we will attach the layout file to the fragment.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>PreferenceManager manager = getPreferenceManager();<br />\nmanager.setSharedPreferencesName(Constants.FOSS_PREFS);</p>\n<p>setPreferencesFromResource(R.xml.sales_data_display, rootKey);</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We are using CheckBox Preferences and modifying their behaviour to work as a Radio Preference List because Radio reference is not provided by Android. We are initializing two checkboxes and attaching a preference listener to unset all other checkboxes which one is selected.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>CheckBoxPreference netSales = (CheckBoxPreference) findPreference(NET_SALES);<br />\nCheckBoxPreference grossSales = (CheckBoxPreference) findPreference(GROSS_SALES);</p>\n<p>Preference.OnPreferenceChangeListener listener = (preference, newValue) -&gt; {<br />\nString key = preference.getKey();</p>\n<p>switch (key) {<br />\ncase GROSS_SALES:<br />\nnetSales.setChecked(false);<br />\nbreak;<br />\ncase NET_SALES:<br />\ngrossSales.setChecked(false);<br />\nbreak;<br />\ndefault:<br />\nbreak;<br />\n}<br />\nreturn (Boolean) newValue;<br />\n};</p>\n<p>netSales.setOnPreferenceChangeListener(listener);<br />\ngrossSales.setOnPreferenceChangeListener(listener);</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We can load SalesDataDisplay Fragment class when a preference button is clicked using fragment transactions as shown below.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>findPreference(getString(R.string.sales_data_display_key)).setOnPreferenceClickListener(preference -&gt; {<br />\ngetFragmentManager().beginTransaction()<br />\n.replace(R.id.fragment_container, SalesDataSettings.newInstance())<br />\n.addToBackStack(null)<br />\n.commit();<br />\nreturn true;<br />\n});</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Shared Preferences Documentation <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences\">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences</a></li>\n<li>Gericop Takisoft Android-Support-Preference-V7-Fix <a href=\"https://github.com/Gericop/Android-Support-Preference-V7-Fix\">https://github.com/Gericop/Android-Support-Preference-V7-Fix</a></li>\n<li>Codebase for Open Event Organizer App <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app</a></li>\n</ol>\n","published":"2018-08-26T11:08:24.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/adding-list-preference-settings-using-preference-fragment-compat/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Performing Database Migrations using DbFlow","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow-768x198.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?resize=768%2C198&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?resize=300%2C77&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?resize=750%2C193&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?resize=1024%2C264&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?w=1102&amp;ssl=1 1102w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17559\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/performing-database-migrations-using-dbflow/dbfow/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?fit=1102%2C284&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1102,284\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"dbfow\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?fit=750%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dbfow.png?fit=1024%2C264&amp;ssl=1\" /><p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">Open Event Organizer Android App</a> we decided to add database migrations for every change in database while development. Two of the reasons behind this &#8211;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The users have some version of the app installed and then during development the developers had to modify the database, let’s say, add a table or modify existing ones. This makes the existing database incompatible with the new app. On adding database migration the upgradation of database takes place automatically and prevent the situation of reinstalling the app.</li>\n<li>Migrations makes it possible to rollback or upgrade to some particular database state. Thus, help in debugging certain changes in isolation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s discuss the implementation details. Consider the scenario when a user adds a new table named SpeakersCall. For creating migration for this change we need to add migration class inside OrgaDatabase class annotated with @Database. We will break it down to look closely at each step.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use @Migration annotation in DbFlow library and specify the new database version (by incrementing the existing version) and the database class.</li>\n<li>Extend BaseMigration and override migrate method.</li>\n<li>The logic used inside the migrate method can be different for different tasks. In the present case we first need to delete any existing table (if exists) with the name SpeakersCall and then recreate that table in database.</li>\n<li>Create an array of java classes which are created/modified.</li>\n<li>We wrap the SQL query inside a Database Wrapper class which prevents it from running recursively.</li>\n<li>FlowManager uses reflection to look up and construct the generated database holder class used in defining the structure for all databases used in this application. So we will getModelAdapter for the class to be recreated and use creation query returned by Model Adapter and execute it.</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Migration(version = 15, database = OrgaDatabase.class)<br />\npublic static class MigrationTo15 extends BaseMigration {</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic void migrate(@NonNull DatabaseWrapper databaseWrapper) {<br />\nTimber.d(&#8220;Running migration for DB version 14&#8221;);</p>\n<p>Class&lt;?&gt;[] recreated = new Class[] {SpeakersCall.class};</p>\n<p>for (Class&lt;?&gt; recreate: recreated) {<br />\nModelAdapter modelAdapter = FlowManager.getModelAdapter(recreate);<br />\ndatabaseWrapper.execSQL(DROP_TABLE + modelAdapter.getTableName());<br />\ndatabaseWrapper.execSQL(modelAdapter.getCreationQuery());<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Similarly, we can write migration for changing a column of table(s).</p>\n","published":"2018-08-26T11:02:25.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/performing-database-migrations-using-dbflow/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Testing the ViewModels in Open Event Organizer App","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"417\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit-768x417.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?resize=768%2C417&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?resize=750%2C407&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?w=774&amp;ssl=1 774w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17556\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/testing-the-viewmodels-in-open-event-organizer-app/junit/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?fit=774%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"774,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"junit\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?fit=750%2C407&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/junit.png?fit=774%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" /><p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">Open Event Organizer Android App</a> we follow Test Driven Development Approach which means the features added in the app are tested thoroughly by unit tests. More tests would ensure better code coverage and fewer bugs. This blog explains how to write tests for Viewmodel class in MVVM architecture.</p>\n<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>\n<p>We will use JUnit4 to write unit tests and Mockito for creating mocks. The OrdersViewModel class returns the list of Order objects to the Fragment class. The objects are requested from OrderRepository class which fetches them from Network and Database. We will create a mock of OrderRepository class since it is out of context and contain logic that doesn’t depend on Orders Respository. Below is the getOrders method that we will test.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> public LiveData&lt;List&lt;Order&gt;&gt; getOrders(long id, boolean reload) {<br />\nif (ordersLiveData.getValue() != null &amp;&amp; !reload)<br />\nreturn ordersLiveData;</p>\n<p>compositeDisposable.add(orderRepository.getOrders(id, reload)<br />\n.compose(dispose(compositeDisposable))<br />\n.doOnSubscribe(disposable -&gt; progress.setValue(true))<br />\n.doFinally(() -&gt; progress.setValue(false))<br />\n.toList()<br />\n.subscribe(ordersLiveData::setValue,<br />\nthrowable -&gt; error.setValue(ErrorUtils.getMessage(throwable).toString())));</p>\n<p>return ordersLiveData;<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We will be using InstantTaskExecutorRule() which is a JUnit Test Rule that swaps the background executor used by the Architecture Components with a different one which executes each task synchronously. We will use setUp() method to load the RxJavaPlugins, RxAndroid plugins and reset them in tearDown method which will ensure each test runs independently from the other and avoid memory leaks. After doing this initialization and basic setup for tests we can begin code the method shouldLoadOrdersSuccessfuly() to test the getOrders method present in ViewModel class. Let’s see the step by step approach.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use Mockito.when to return Observables one by one from ORDERS_LIST whenever the method getOrders of the mock orderRepository is called.</li>\n<li>We will use Mockito.InOrder and pass orders, orderRepository and progress to check if they are called in a particular order.</li>\n<li>We will use .observeForever method to observe on LiveData objects and add a ArrayList on change.</li>\n<li>Finally, we will test and verify if the methods are called in order.</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Test<br />\npublic void shouldLoadOrdersSuccessfully() {<br />\nwhen(orderRepository.getOrders(EVENT_ID, false))<br />\n.thenReturn(Observable.fromIterable(ORDERS_LIST));</p>\n<p>InOrder inOrder = Mockito.inOrder(orders, orderRepository, progress);</p>\n<p>ordersViewModel.getProgress().observeForever(progress);</p>\n<p>orders.onChanged(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;());</p>\n<p>ordersViewModel.getOrders(EVENT_ID, false);</p>\n<p>inOrder.verify(orders).onChanged(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;());<br />\ninOrder.verify(orderRepository).getOrders(EVENT_ID, false);<br />\ninOrder.verify(progress).onChanged(true);<br />\ninOrder.verify(progress).onChanged(false);<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Similar approach can be followed for writing tests to check other behaviour of the ViewModel.</p>\n<h2><b>References</b></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Official Documentation for testing. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/core/executor/testing/InstantTaskExecutorRule\">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/core/executor/testing/InstantTaskExecutorRule</a></li>\n<li>Official Documentation for JUnit.  <a href=\"https://junit.org/junit4/\">https://junit.org/junit4/</a></li>\n<li>Official documentation for Mockito.  <a href=\"http://site.mockito.org/\">http://site.mockito.org/</a></li>\n<li>Open Event Organizer App codebase.  <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app</a></li>\n</ol>\n","published":"2018-08-26T10:57:23.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/testing-the-viewmodels-in-open-event-organizer-app/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Swipe to Check In/Out in Open Event Organizer App","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"455\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check-768x455.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?resize=768%2C455&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?resize=750%2C444&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?resize=1024%2C607&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17553\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/swipe-to-check-in-out-in-open-event-organizer-app/check-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?fit=2500%2C1481&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2500,1481\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"check\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?fit=750%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/check.jpg?fit=1024%2C607&amp;ssl=1\" /><p><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">Open Event Organizer App</a> didn’t provide any option for the Event Organizer to view the list of Attendees present under an Order and check them in/out the event. Therefore, we designed a system such that the Organizer can just swipe the attendee present under an order to check them in or out. In this blog post, I will discuss how we implemented this functionality in Open Event Organizer App without using any third party libraries.</p>\n<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>\n<p>We will create a separate class SwipeController.java which extends ItemTouchHelper.SimpleCallback and provide the swiping functionalities to our plain old recyclerview. We will call the super constructor with ItemTouchHelper.LEFT and ItemTouchHelper.RIGHT as arguments to provide left as well as right movements in each recyclerview list item. The bitmaps and paint object initialized here will be used later in onDraw.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public SwipeController(OrderDetailViewModel orderDetailViewModel, OrderAttendeesAdapter orderAttendeesAdapter, Context context) {<br />\nsuper(0, ItemTouchHelper.LEFT | ItemTouchHelper.RIGHT);<br />\nthis.orderDetailViewModel = orderDetailViewModel;<br />\nthis.orderAttendeesAdapter = orderAttendeesAdapter;</p>\n<p>closeIcon = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(context.getResources(), R.drawable.close);<br />\ndoneIcon = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(context.getResources(), R.drawable.done);</p>\n<p>paintGreen.setColor(context.getResources().getColor(R.color.light_green_500));<br />\npaintRed.setColor(context.getResources().getColor(R.color.red_500));<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Next, we will override getMovementFlags method. This method decides the allowed movement directions for each recyclerview item.

So in this blog we’ll see how we implemented this functionality in the Orga App.</p>\n<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>\n<p>There is a fragment showing the list of all orders for that event. The user will be able to click on order from the list which will then take the user to another fragment where Order details will be displayed. We will be following MVVM architecture to implement this functionality using REST API provided by Open Event Server. Let’s get started.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we will create Order Model class. This contains various fields and relationship attributes to setup the table in database using RazizLabs DbFlow annotations.</p>\n<p>Then, We will make a GET request to the server using Retrofit 2  to fetch Order object.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@GET(&#8220;orders/{identifier}?include=event&#8221;)<br />\nObservable&lt;Order&gt; getOrder(@Path(&#8220;identifier&#8221;) String identifier);</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The server will return the Order details in form of a Order object and then we will save it in local  database so that when there is no network connectivity then also we can show data to the user and user can refresh to fetch the latest data from network. The network observable handles fetching data from network and disk observable handles saving data in local database.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@NonNull<br />\n@Override<br />\npublic Observable&lt;Order&gt; getOrder(String orderIdentifier, boolean reload) {<br />\nObservable&lt;Order&gt; diskObservable = Observable.defer(() -&gt;<br />\nrepository<br />\n.getItems(Order.class, Order_Table.identifier.eq(orderIdentifier)).take(1)<br />\n);</p>\n<p>Observable&lt;Order&gt; networkObservable = Observable.defer(() -&gt;<br />\norderApi.getOrder(orderIdentifier)<br />\n.doOnNext(order -&gt; repository<br />\n.save(Order.class, order)<br />\n.subscribe()));</p>\n<p>return repository<br />\n.observableOf(Order.class)<br />\n.reload(reload)<br />\n.withDiskObservable(diskObservable)<br />\n.withNetworkObservable(networkObservable)<br />\n.build();<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now, we will make a Fragment class that will bind the layout file to the model in the onCreateView method using DataBindingUtil. Further, we will be observing on ViewModel to reflect changes of Order, Progress and Error objects in the UI in the onStart method of the Fragment.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public class OrderDetailFragment extends BaseFragment implements OrderDetailView {</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {<br />\nbinding = DataBindingUtil.inflate(inflater, R.layout.order_detail_fragment, container, false);</p>\n<p>orderDetailViewModel = ViewModelProviders.of(this, viewModelFactory).get(OrderDetailViewModel.class);</p>\n<p>return binding.getRoot();<br />\n}</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic void onStart() {<br />\nsuper.onStart();<br />\nsetupRefreshListener();</p>\n<p>orderDetailViewModel.getOrder(orderIdentifier, eventId, false).observe(this, this::showOrderDetails);<br />\norderDetailViewModel.getProgress().observe(this, this::showProgress);<br />\norderDetailViewModel.getError().observe(this, this::showError);<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Next, we will create OrderDetailsViewModel.This is the ViewModel class which interacts with the repository class to get data and the fragment class to show that data in UI.</p>\n<p>Whenever the user opens Order details page, the method getOrder() twill be called which will request an Order object from OrderRepository, wrap it in MutableLiveData and provide it to Fragment.</p>\n<p>Using MutableLiveData to hold the data makes the data reactive i.e. changes in UI are reflected automatically when the object changes. Further, we don’t have to worry handling the screen rotation as LIveData handles it all by itself.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>  public LiveData&lt;Order&gt; getOrder(String identifier, long eventId, boolean reload) {<br />\nif (orderLiveData.getValue() != null &amp;&amp; !reload)<br />\nreturn orderLiveData;</p>\n<p>compositeDisposable.add(orderRepository.getOrder(identifier, reload)<br />\n.compose(dispose(compositeDisposable))<br />\n.doOnSubscribe(disposable -&gt; progress.setValue(true))<br />\n.doFinally(() -&gt; progress.setValue(false))<br />\n.subscribe(order -&gt; orderLiveData.setValue(order),<br />\nthrowable -&gt; error.setValue(ErrorUtils.getMessage(throwable))));</p>\n<p>if (!reload) {<br />\ngetEvent(eventId);<br />\n}</p>\n<p>return orderLiveData;<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><b>References</b></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Codebase for Open Event Orga App <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\">https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app</a></li>\n<li>Official documentation for LiveData Architecture Component <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata\">https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata</a></li>\n<li>Official Github Repository of Retrofit  <a href=\"https://github.com/square/retrofit\">https://github.com/square/retrofit</a></li>\n<li>Official Github Repository for RxJava <a href=\"https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava\">https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava</a></li>\n</ol>\n","published":"2018-08-26T10:42:44.000Z","author":"Masquerade0097","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/showing-order-details-in-eventyay-organizer-android-app/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":"blog.fossasia.org"}},{"title":"Using Contextual Action Bar as Selection Toolbar","content":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1-768x1365.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?resize=768%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?resize=113%2C200&amp;ssl=1 113w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?resize=731%2C1300&amp;ssl=1 731w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?resize=1024%2C1820&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"17546\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/using-contextual-action-bar-as-selection-toolbar/cont-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?fit=1080%2C1920&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"contextual acion bar\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?fit=731%2C1300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cont-1.png?fit=1024%2C1820&amp;ssl=1\" /><p><b>In </b><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\"><b>Open Event Android Organizer App</b></a> we were using Android Action Bar as Toolbar to allow deleting and editing of the list items but this implementation was buggy and not upto the industry standards. So we decided to implement this using Contextual Action Bar as a selection toolbar.</p>\n<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>\n<p>We are using MVP Architecture so there will be Fragment class to interact with the UI and Presenter class to handle all the business logic and interact with network layer.</p>\n<p>The SessionsFragment is the Fragment class for displaying List of Sessions to the user. We can long press any item to select it, entering into contextual action bar mode. Using this we will be able to select multiple items from list by a click and delete/edit them from toolbar.</p>\n<p>To enter in Contextual Action Bar Mode use</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ActionMode actionMode = getActivity().startActionMode(actionCallback);</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To exit Contextual Action Bar Mode use</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>if (actionMode != null)<br />\nactionMode.finish();</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We will implement Action.Callback interface in out fragment class. It’s contains three method declarations &#8211;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>onCreateActionMode &#8211; This method is executed when the contextual action bar is  created. We will inflate the toolbar menu using MenuInflator and set new status bar color.</li>\n<li>onPrepareActionMode &#8211; This method is executed after onCreateActionMode and also whenever the Contextual Action Bar is invalidated so we will set the visibility of delete button in toolbar here and return true to ignify that we have made some changes.</li>\n<li>onActionItemClicked &#8211; This method is executed whenever a menu item in toolbar is clicked. We will call the function showDeleteDialog.</li>\n<li>onDestroyActionMode &#8211; This method is executed whenever user leaves the contextual action bar mode by pressing back button on toolbar or back button in keyboard etc. Here we will make unselect all the selected list items and the status bar color.</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public ActionMode.Callback actionCallback = new ActionMode.Callback() {<br />\n@Override<br />\npublic boolean onCreateActionMode(ActionMode mode, Menu menu) {<br />\nMenuInflater inflater = mode.getMenuInflater();<br />\ninflater.inflate(R.menu.menu_sessions, menu);if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {<br />\nstatusBarColor = getActivity().getWindow().getStatusBarColor();<br />\ngetActivity().getWindow().setStatusBarColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.color_top_surface));<br />\n}<br />\nreturn true;<br />\n}@Override<br />\npublic boolean onPrepareActionMode(ActionMode mode, Menu menu) {<br />\nMenuItem menuItemDelete = menu.findItem(R.id.del);<br />\nMenuItem menuItemEdit = menu.findItem(R.id.edit);<br />\nmenuItemEdit.setVisible(editMode);<br />\nmenuItemDelete.setVisible(deletingMode);<br />\nreturn true;<br />\n}</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic boolean onActionItemClicked(ActionMode mode, MenuItem item) {<br />\nswitch (item.getItemId()) {<br />\ncase R.id.del:<br />\nshowDeleteDialog();<br />\nbreak;<br />\ncase R.id.edit:<br />\ngetPresenter().updateSession();<br />\nbreak;<br />\ndefault:<br />\nreturn false;<br />\n}<br />\nreturn false;<br />\n}</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic void onDestroyActionMode(ActionMode mode) {<br />\nactionMode = null;<br />\ngetPresenter().resetToolbarToDefaultState();<br />\ngetPresenter().unselectSessionList();<br />\nif (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {<br />\n//return to &#8220;old&#8221; color of status bar<br />\ngetActivity().getWindow().setStatusBarColor(statusBarColor);<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n};</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The showDeleteDialog method shows a AlertDialog to the user before deleting the selected items in the list.

In Ember every entity has some predefined set of methods, that it goes through the existence of the application. Route is not different from it. Our main goal is to restore the state of the controller every time we entered into a route, so that we receive a clean and new instance and not the previous state. The hook that fits in the situation is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">setupController()</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

So instead of showing the user the link of the generated badge on the form, what we can do is that we can send a mail to user with the link of generated badge. However listening for the completion of generated badge from the cloud function is not possible, as cloud functions are based on serverless architecture. This can be done using the listeners for the realtime database events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Generated badge from the backend will be uploaded to the Firebase Storage, but applying a listener for storage events, will not give us the information of the sender and some other metadata. So after uploading the link on the database, we can use the public link generated and can push a dict to the realtime database with the necessary user information for sending mail.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Procedure</span></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Fetching the necessary information to be pushed on the Firebase realtime database.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>def</b> <b>send_badge_mail</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(badgeId, userId, badgeLink):</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   ref = firebase_db.reference(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;badgeMails&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   print(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;Pushing badge generation mail to : &#8216;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, badgeId)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   ref.child(userId).child(datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat().replace(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;-&#8216;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;_&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).replace(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;:&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;U&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).replace(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;.&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;D&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)).set({</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;badgeId&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: badgeId,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;badgeLink&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: badgeLink</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   })</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   print(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;Pushed badge generation mail to : &#8216;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, badgeId)</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Payload consists of the downloadable link of the badge and the root node is the userID.

The problem is that we cannot send a request to an external API from firebase cloud functions in free plan and secondly we have to them bypass the call to realtime database and design a logic to sort out the details from the realtime database using python admin sdk. So, our approach in solving this is that we will use the realtime database with the cloud functions to store the data and using the firebase admin sdk will sort the entries and using binary search will count the statistics efficiently..</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Procedure</span></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Configuring the database URL in admin SDK</span></li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred, {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;storageBucket&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;badgeyay-195bf.appspot.com&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;databaseURL&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;https://badgeyay-195bf.firebaseio.com&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   })</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Write the mail data in realtime database using cloud function on promise resolvement</span></li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>function</b> <b>writeMailData</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(uid, state, reason) {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span> <b>if</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (state === </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;success&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   db.ref(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;mails&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     .push()</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     .set({</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       &#8230;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     }, err =&gt; {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       &#8230;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     });</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> }</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">}</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Fetching the mail data from the realtime database in python admin sdk</span></li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>def</b> <b>get_admin_stat</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">():</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   mail_ref = firebasedb.reference(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8216;mails&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   mail_resp = mail_ref.get()</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   &#8230;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   curr_date = datetime.datetime.utcnow()</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   prev_month_date = curr_date &#8211; relativedelta(months=1)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   last_three_days_date = curr_date &#8211; relativedelta(days=3)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   last_seven_days_date = curr_date &#8211; relativedelta(days=7)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   last_day_date = curr_date &#8211; relativedelta(days=1)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   &#8230;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This will fetch the current date and them generates the relative dates in past.

We handled this challenge and came up with options to share Event with other social media apps. Along with that user can send Email to users containing event description with just a click. All this through a UI that our user will love interacting with. Let’s see how we implemented this.</p>\n<h2>Specifications</h2>\n<p>We designed a UI given below which offer four functionalities to the user in a single screen.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Event Name and Date are shown in the CardView.</li>\n<li>User can copy Event External URL by clicking on Copy URL option.</li>\n<li>User can send Email containing information about the Event like ( Name, Description, Starting and Ending Date-Time for the Event) via Email by clicking on Email option.</li>\n<li>User can share the same information described in point three via other social media/chatting apps etc by clicking on many more option.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The is the Event Model class ia a POJO containing the associated attributes.</p>\n<p>We will use Retrofit to fetch Event object from server through a GET request in EventApi class.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@GET(&#8220;events/{id}?include=tickets&#8221;)<br />\nObservable&lt;Event&gt; getEvent(@Path(&#8220;id&#8221;) long id);</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Then we will use the getEvent method of EventRepositoryImpl class to make the request for us using EventApi class and then pass on the Response Event object to the ViewModel by wrapping it in RxJava Observable. We are accepting a boolean field named reload which decdes whether we need to reuse the existing Event object from Local Database  or fetch a new object from server.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Override<br />\npublic Observable&lt;Event&gt; getEvent(long eventId, boolean reload) {<br />\nObservable&lt;Event&gt; diskObservable = Observable.defer(() -&gt;<br />\nrepository<br />\n.getItems(Event.class, Event_Table.id.eq(eventId))<br />\n.filter(Event::isComplete)<br />\n.take(1)<br />\n);</p>\n<p>Observable&lt;Event&gt; networkObservable = Observable.defer(() -&gt;<br />\neventApi<br />\n.getEvent(eventId)<br />\n.doOnNext(this::saveEvent));</p>\n<p>return repository.observableOf(Event.class)<br />\n.reload(reload)<br />\n.withDiskObservable(diskObservable)<br />\n.withNetworkObservable(networkObservable)<br />\n.build();<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In ShareEventVewModel, we are calling the getEvent from EventRepositoryImpl class, construct a LiveData object from it so that UI could observe changes on it. Methods getShareableInformation, getShareableUrl, getShareableSubject provide the shareable information to the UI which is further shared with other apps.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public class ShareEventViewModel extends ViewModel {</p>\n<p>protected LiveData&lt;Event&gt; getEvent(long eventId, boolean reload) {<br />\nif (eventLiveData.getValue() != null &amp;&amp; !reload)<br />\nreturn eventLiveData;</p>\n<p>compositeDisposable.add(eventRepository.getEvent(eventId, reload)<br />\n.doOnSubscribe(disposable -&gt; progress.setValue(true))<br />\n.doFinally(() -&gt; progress.setValue(false))<br />\n.subscribe(event -&gt; {<br />\nthis.event = event;<br />\neventLiveData.setValue(event);<br />\n},<br />\nthrowable -&gt; error.setValue(ErrorUtils.getMessage(throwable))));</p>\n<p>return eventLiveData;<br />\n}</p>\n<p>public String getShareableInformation() {<br />\nreturn Utils.getShareableInformation(event);<br />\n}</p>\n<p>}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In ShareEventFragment class does the work of binding the UI to the model using data binding. It observes the LiveData objects supplied by presenter and reflect the changes in UI to the LiveData object.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public class ShareEventFragment extends BaseFragment implements ShareEventView {</p>\n<p>public void shareEvent() {<br />\nIntent shareIntent = new Intent();<br />\nshareIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND);<br />\nshareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, shareEventViewModel.getShareableInformation());<br />\nshareIntent.setType(&#8220;text/plain&#8221;);<br />\nstartActivity(Intent.createChooser(shareIntent, getResources().getText(R.string.send_to)));<br />\n}</p>\n<p>public void shareByEmail() {<br />\nIntent shareIntent = new Intent();<br />\nshareIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SENDTO);<br />\nshareIntent.setType(&#8220;message/rfc822&#8221;);<br />\nshareIntent.setData(Uri.parse(&#8220;mailto:&#8221;));<br />\nshareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, shareEventViewModel.getEmailSubject());<br />\nshareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, shareEventViewModel.getShareableInformation());<br />\ntry {<br />\nstartActivity(Intent.createChooser(shareIntent, getResources().getText(R.string.send_to)));<br />\n} catch (android.content.ActivityNotFoundException ex) {<br />\nViewUtils.showSnackbar(binding.getRoot(), &#8220;There are no email clients installed&#8221;);<br />\n}<br />\n}</p>\n<p>public void copyUrlToClipboard() {<br />\nClipboardManager clipboard = (ClipboardManager) getActivity().getSystemService(Context.CLIPBOARD_SERVICE);<br />\nString eventUrl = shareEventViewModel.getShareableUrl();<br />\nif (eventUrl == null) {<br />\nViewUtils.showSnackbar(binding.getRoot(), &#8220;Event does not have a Public URL&#8221;);<br />\n} else {<br />\nClipData clip = ClipData.newPlainText(&#8220;Event URL&#8221;, shareEventViewModel.getShareableUrl());<br />\nclipboard.setPrimaryClip(clip);<br />\nViewUtils.showSnackbar(binding.getRoot(), &#8220;Event URL Copied to Clipboard&#8221;);<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The layout file contains the Event object bind to the UI using Two way Data Binding.

So, we added a feature to allow users to change their existing password. This blog explains the technical details to implement this feature following MVVM architecture and using highly efficient libraries like Retrofit, RxJava, Raziz Labs DbFlow, Data Binding.</p>\n<h2>Specifications</h2>\n<p>We will implement a page where users can enter their old password and new password along with a confirm password field. Their will be a login button to send the password change request to server. Server then return a response and we will provide feedback regarding the request. We are following MVP architecture so there will be a Model class, Fragment class, Presenter class and Network Layer to make network requests.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with creating ChangePassword model class. There are three fields to store old password, new password and new confirmed password. Several Lombok annotations like @Data, @AllArgsConstructor, @NoArgsConstructor are used to avoid boilerplate code for getters, setters and constructors. @JsonNaming annotation is used to translate the Java Object names to KebabCase when they are serialized.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Data<br />\n@AllArgsConstructor<br />\n@NoArgsConstructor<br />\n@JsonNaming(PropertyNamingStrategy.KebabCaseStrategy.class)<br />\npublic class ChangePassword {</p>\n<p>public String oldPassword;<br />\npublic String newPassword;</p>\n<p>@JsonIgnore<br />\npublic String confirmNewPassword;<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The layout file is binded to model using Data Binding. There will be three TextInputEditText fields for user input. An option to toggle password visibility and a login button.</p>\n<p>The Fragment class binds layout file to the Fragment and handle UI stuff. Presenter is called to make Login request when login button is pressed.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public class ChangePasswordFragment extends BaseFragment&lt;ChangePasswordPresenter&gt; implements ChangePasswordView {</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,<br />\nBundle savedInstanceState) {<br />\nbinding = DataBindingUtil.inflate(inflater, R.layout.change_password_fragment, container, false);<br />\nvalidator = new Validator(binding);</p>\n<p>AppCompatActivity activity = ((AppCompatActivity) getActivity());<br />\nactivity.setSupportActionBar(binding.toolbar);</p>\n<p>ActionBar actionBar = activity.getSupportActionBar();<br />\nif (actionBar != null) {<br />\nactionBar.setHomeButtonEnabled(true);<br />\nactionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);<br />\n}</p>\n<p>return binding.getRoot();<br />\n}</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic void onStart() {<br />\nsuper.onStart();<br />\ngetPresenter().attach(this);<br />\nbinding.setOrganizerPassword(getPresenter().getChangePasswordObject());<br />\ngetPresenter().start();</p>\n<p>binding.btnChangePassword.setOnClickListener(view -&gt; {<br />\nif (!validator.validate())<br />\nreturn;</p>\n<p>String url = binding.url.baseUrl.getText().toString().trim();<br />\ngetPresenter().setBaseUrl(url, binding.url.overrideUrl.isChecked());<br />\ngetPresenter().changePasswordRequest(binding.oldPassword.getText().toString(),<br />\nbinding.newPassword.getText().toString(),<br />\nbinding.confirmNewPassword.getText().toString());</p>\n<p>});<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>When the Login button is pressed, changePasswordRequest() method is called which makes an asynchronous call to ChangePasswordModel in order to perform the task of sending and receiving data from network in a different thread than the UI thread. Along with making requests, this method also verifies the password typed in confirm password field and send the the error as well as success message to the fragment.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public class ChangePasswordPresenter extends AbstractBasePresenter&lt;ChangePasswordView&gt; {</p>\n<p>public void changePasswordRequest(String oldPassword, String newPassword, String confirmPassword) {<br />\nif (!newPassword.equals(confirmPassword)) {<br />\ngetView().showError(&#8220;Passwords Do Not Match&#8221;);<br />\nreturn;<br />\n}</p>\n<p>organizerPasswordObject.setOldPassword(oldPassword);<br />\norganizerPasswordObject.setNewPassword(newPassword);<br />\norganizerPasswordObject.setConfirmNewPassword(confirmPassword);</p>\n<p>changePasswordModel.changePassword(organizerPasswordObject)<br />\n.compose(disposeCompletable(getDisposable()))<br />\n.compose(progressiveErroneousCompletable(getView()))<br />\n.subscribe(() -&gt; getView().onSuccess(&#8220;Password Changed Successfully&#8221;), Logger::logError);<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We are using Retrofit to make POST Request to server using the REST API. @Body annotation denotes the object request body which here contains a Map&lt;String, ChangePassword&gt; object. The Response from server is captured in Observable&lt;ChangePasswordResponse&gt; which is an RxJava Observable.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@POST(&#8220;auth/change-password&#8221;)<br />\nObservable&lt;ChangePasswordResponse&gt; changePassword(@Body Map&lt;String, ChangePassword&gt; changePassword);</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This is the declaration for the method in Network Layer where the actual network request is made. It takes as input the changePassword object from Presenter which is already binded with data. Then it uses RxJava to asynchronously call the Api class and pass in the Map&lt;String, ChangePassword&gt; object. The result is then processed and Completable object is returned to the presenter.

In this Blog Post we will see how we added this functionality in the app.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-app\"><b>Open Event Android Organizer Application</b></a> is a client for <a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server\"><b>Open Event Server</b></a> which provides the REST API.</p>\n<h2>Problem</h2>\n<p>There can be various Sessions associated with Tracks for an Event. <a href=\"https://open-event-api-dev.herokuapp.com/\"><b>Open Event API</b></a> had the endpoint to implement Creating Session but the Orga app didn’t, so we worked on creating a Session in the app.</p>\n<p>The UI for creating a Session is shown above. User can fill in the necessary details and click on the green Floating Action Button to create a Session.</p>\n<h2>How to implement functionality?</h2>\n<p>We will follow MVP Architecture and use Retrofit 2.x, RxJava, Dagger, Jackson, Data Binding and other industry standard libraries to implement this functionality.</p>\n<p>Firstly, let’s create Session model class specifying the attributes and relationships to set up in database using RazizLabs DbFlow library. The POJO will be serialized into JSON by Jackson library to be passed on as a part of RequestBody to server.</p>\n<p>Now we will create SessionApi class that will contain the request details to be passed to Retrofit. <b>@POST</b> denotes a POST request and <b>@Body</b> denotes the requestBody of the request which is a Session object.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public interface SessionApi {<br />\n@POST(&#8220;sessions&#8221;)<br />\nObservable&lt;Session&gt; postSession(@Body Session session);<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This is the CreateSessionFragment class that contains the code binding model to the view. The Fragment class implements the CreateSessionView class overriding the method declarations present there. The <b>@Inject</b> annotation of Dagger is used to load singleton presenter instance lazily to improve app’s performance.</p>\n<p>Event-Id and Track-Id’s are retrieved from Bundle from Fragment Transaction. These are then passed on to presenter when Create Session button is pressed. There are other methods to show binding progressbar, snackbar and other UI components to show progress of the background request to server and database.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public class CreateSessionFragment extends BaseFragment&lt;CreateSessionPresenter&gt; implements CreateSessionView {</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup</p>\n<p>container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {<br />\nbinding = DataBindingUtil.inflate(inflater,</p>\n<p>R.layout.session_create_layout, container, false);<br />\nvalidator = new Validator(binding.form);</p>\n<p>binding.sessionCreate.setOnClickListener(view -&gt; {<br />\nif (validator.validate()) {<br />\ngetPresenter().createSession(trackId, eventId);<br />\n}<br />\n});</p>\n<p>return binding.getRoot();<br />\n}</p>\n<p>@Override<br />\npublic void onStart() {<br />\nsuper.onStart();<br />\ngetPresenter().attach(this);<br />\nbinding.setSession(getPresenter().getSession());<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the Presenter createSession method is called when create button is pressed in UI. The method attaches track-id and event-id to Session object. This is necessary for Relationship constraints on Session Model. Then after binding all the data to Session object, we pass it on to SessionRepository. The success response is provided to user by passing success response in getView().onSuccess() method.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>public class CreateSessionPresenter extends</p>\n<p>AbstractBasePresenter&lt;CreateSessionView&gt; {</p>\n<p>public Session getSession() {<br />\nreturn session;<br />\n}</p>\n<p>public void createSession(long trackId, long eventId) {</p>\n<p>Track track = new Track();<br />\nEvent event = new Event();</p>\n<p>track.setId(trackId);<br />\nevent.setId(eventId);<br />\nsession.setTrack(track);<br />\nsession.setEvent(event);</p>\n<p>sessionRepository<br />\n.createSession(session)<br />\n.compose(dispose(getDisposable()))<br />\n.compose(progressiveErroneous(getView()))<br />\n.subscribe(createdSession -&gt;</p>\n<p>getView().onSuccess(&#8220;Session Created&#8221;), Logger::logError);<br />\n}<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The SessionRepository uses <b>RxJava</b> to make asynchronous <b>Retrofit</b> Call to Server. We throw a Network Error to user if the device does not have Internet Connectivity.</p>\n<p>The session object accepted as a parameter in createSession method is passed on to sessionApi. It will return Observable&lt;Session&gt; Response which we will process in doOnNext() method. Then the Session object along with required foreign key relationships with Track and Event is saved in database for offline use.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>@Override<br />\npublic Observable&lt;Session&gt; createSession(Session session) {<br />\nif (!repository.isConnected()) {<br />\nreturn Observable.error(new Throwable(Constants.NO_NETWORK));<br />\n}return sessionApi<br />\n.postSession(session)<br />\n.doOnNext(created -&gt; {<br />\ncreated.setTrack(session.getTrack());<br />\ncreated.setEvent(session.getEvent());<br />\nrepository<br />\n.save(Session.class, created)<br />\n.subscribe();<br />\n})<br />\n.subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())<br />\n.observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread());<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The above code snippets are from Open Event Orga Application.

style=\"font-weight: 400\">SUSI Smart Speaker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is an Open Source speaker with many exciting features. The user needs an Android or iOS device to set up the speaker. You can refer </span><a href=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/initial-setups-for-connecting-susi-smart-speaker-with-iphone-ipad/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for initial connection to SUSI Smart Speaker. In this post, we will see how a user can connect SUSI Smart Speaker to iOS devices (iPhone/iPad).</span></p>\n<p><b>Implementation &#8211;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first step is to detect whether an iOS device connects to SUSI.AI hotspot or not. For this, we match the currently connected wifi SSID with SUSI.AI hotspot SSID. If it matches, we show the connected device in Device Activity to proceed further with setups.</span></p>\n<p><b>Choosing Room &#8211;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Room name is basically the location of your SUSI Smart Speaker in the home. You may have multiple SUSI Smart Speaker in different rooms, so the purpose of adding the room is to differentiate between them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the user clicks on Wi-Fi displayed cell, it starts the initial setups. We are using </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><code>didSelectRowAt</code></span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> method of <code>UITableViewDelegate</code> to get which cell is selected. On clicking the displayed Wi-Fi cell, a popup is open with a Room Location Text field.</span></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em

The blog will solve the difficult task of communication between two fragments of a single activity. For passing data between multiple fragments of different activities, refer to [1].</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How to pass data between fragments?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this blog, I will pass data from Fragment 2 to Fragment 1 only. But vice versa or passing data from both the fragments can also be made using the same given approach.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, make a static method in Fragment 1 which can set the parameters i.e. the value of the variables as soon as the fragment is inflated as follow</span></li>\n</ul>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color: #a9b7c6;background: #282b2e;padding: 0.5em\"><span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">public</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">static</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">void</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\" style=\"color: #ffc66d\">setParameters</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">int</span> one, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">int</span> two, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">int</span> three)</span> </span>{\r\n        Fragment1.firstValue = one;\r\n        Fragment1.secondValue = two;\r\n        Fragment1.thirdValue = three;\r\n    }\r\n</pre>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now, there is one point to mark that Fragment 1 will be inflated only when Fragment 2 gets destroyed. Else, other than default inflation of Fragment 1, there is no way Fragment 1 can be inflated after navigating to Fragment 2.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, override the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">OnDestroy()</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> method of Fragment 2 and use the </span><b>setParameters() </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">method to set the value of variables from Fragment 2 to be used in Fragment 1.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color: #a9b7c6;background: #282b2e;padding: 0.5em\"><span class=\"hljs-variable\" style=\"color: #629755\">@Override</span>\r\n    public void onDestroyView() {\r\n        super<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\" style=\"color: #e8bf6a\">.onDestroyView</span>();\r\n        highValue = getValueFromText(highLimit, 0, highLimitMax);\r\n        updatePeriodValue = getValueFromText(updatePeriod, updatePeriodMin, updatePeriodMax + 100);\r\n        Fragment1<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\" style=\"color: #e8bf6a\">.setParameters</span>(selectedSensor, highValue, updatePeriodValue);\r\n    }</pre>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here, the </span><b>highValue</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><b>updatePeriodValue</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><b>selectedSensor</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are the variables being used in the Lux Meter fragment in PSLab Android app. But they can be replaced by the necessary variables as per the app.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, in this way, we can pass data between the fragments of the same Activity in an Android application.

The demonstration will be purely from the work I have done under PR </span><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-android/pull/1355\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">#1355</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in </span><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-android\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PSLab Android</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> repository.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why prevent the Activity from operating?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When using Bottom Sheet in Android, it is preferable to dim the screen behind the Bottom Sheet to provide a good user experience. But the dimming of the screen is itself an indication that the screen won’t work. Also, if the Bottom Sheet is open and while sliding it, if, by mistake, any button in the background of the bottom sheet gets pressed, then if the function related to that button starts executing then it can create a bad user experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, in PSLab Android app, in Accelerometer instrument, there are record/pause and delete buttons in the toolbar as shown in figure 1. Now, if the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">bottom sheet is opened and while closing it if the delete button is by mistake pressed by the user, then whole recorded data gets deleted. Thus, it’s a good practice to prevent the background Activity from operating while Bottom Sheet is opened.</span></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"17477\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/prevent-android-activity-from-operating-while-using-bottom-sheet-in-pslab-app/screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27.png?fit=327%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"327,582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Accelerometer Instrument in PSLab Android app\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27.png?fit=327%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27.png?fit=327%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-17477 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27.png?resize=327%2C582&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"327\" height=\"582\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27.png?w=327&amp;ssl=1 327w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-from-2018-08-24-20-13-27.png?resize=112%2C200&amp;ssl=1 112w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 1.

null.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Implementing the alert-box[1]</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus if the sensorManger variable was null it notified that the sensor was not present in           the device and

Lab</a> Android app has got various functionality such as voltmeter, resistance measurement, capacitance measurement, frequency measurement as well as Count pulse measurement , one of the missing functionality among these is the Ammeter, currently in PSLab there is no direct way of measuring current. In this blog I will be discussing an indirect method of measuring current in PSLab.</p>\n<h2>Basics of measuring current</h2>\n<p>Generally in all multimeters , current is measured using  an Ammeter which uses the property of galvanometer to measure to measure current in PSLab. But as the PSLab doesn’t has any such embedded Galvanometer we cannot have a seperate Ammeter in it, but there is another method to measure the current, which is using the famous OHm’s law i.e V/I = R</p>\n<p>In PSLab we can measure the voltage across any elements, plus we can also measure  the resistance of any circuit element in PSLab, the theory used for measuring current is stated as follows.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We connect the current-source to any known resistant(or any resistance) and then measure the voltage across the resistor.</li>\n<li>Finally using<b> ohm’s law </b>the current will be <b>voltage / resistance</b>.[2]</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step-by-step guide on measuring the current</h2>\n<p>Here is the step by step guide on how to measure the current in PSLab:-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take any arbitrary resistor and measure it’s resistance. To measure the resistance follow these steps :-\n<ol>\n<li>Take a resistance and connect it to any two pins of breadboard</li>\n<li>Connect one end to the sen pin and the other end to the GND pin of PSLab device.</li>\n<li>Now go to the Android app and select multimeter instrument.</li>\n<li>Now in the multimeter instrument set the knob to resistance, in the measure section</li>\n<li>Now click on the read button and then it will show the resistance of the resistor</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Now that you have measured the resistance of the resistor, now connect the current source across the resistors.</li>\n<li>Now finally measure the voltage across the resistor. To measure the voltage follow these steps.\n<ol>\n<li>Take two male to male wires and connect it’s two individual ends to the two ends of the resistor.</li>\n<li>Now connect one of the other two ends of the wire to the any one of the CH1, CH2 or CH3 and the other end to GND respectively.</li>\n<li>Now go to the Android app and select multimeter instrument.</li>\n<li>Now in the multimeter instrument set the knob to the channel which you have selected i.e CH1, CH2 or CH3 , in the voltage section.</li>\n<li>Now click on the read button and then it will show the voltage across the resistor.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Now using the using<b> ohm’s law </b>the current will be <b>voltage / resistance</b>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus using these steps one can find the current in PSLab Android App.</p>\n<h2>Images for the Experiment</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img data-attachment-id=\"17433\"

Lab</a> Android app has various functionalities implemented in it, one of the major implemented functionalities is the knob in the multimeter, In my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IU_lpdt4sHI4euM543bBlHwYpv8vwwjxoB76sW1i5HA/edit?usp=sharing\">previous blog </a>I have mentioned about the knobs and how exactly it has been implemented, one the major problems in the knob is that it doesn’t fits correctly in all layouts, even though constraint layout is used , as it has different text-views positioned in a circular constraint in which exact circular radius has to be mentioned (which cannot be constrained), mentioned in my previous-blog there comes the idea of creating different layouts for different-screens in android.</p>\n<h3>Need to create multiple layouts for different screen</h3>\n<p>There arises this question of the use of creating multiple layouts for different screens when you can create a flexible layout using tools such as constraint layout. The answer to this question is that in some cases such as as the case of circular constraint or using a linear-layout  one has to use use hard-coded dimensions which thus makes difference in various screens on, there comes the need of using size and orientation quantifiers i.e making layout according to screen sizes.

Notifications are an important part of the project. We show each registered user notifications based on their activity. This blog post goes over the implementation of the notification action buttons in the notification panel.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Notification Action Model</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The model for Notification action is very simple. It has the following variables:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Subject: The subject of the notification. E.g. ‘event’, ‘order’ etc.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">actionType: The action that can be taken by the user for that notification. E.g: ‘view’, ‘submit’.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">subjectId: The id of the subject. In case of an event, it will store the event id. Similarly for other cases.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Link: The link to be applied to the button. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">import</span> <span style=\"color: #0e84b5;font-weight: bold\">attr</span> <span style=\"color: #0e84b5;font-weight: bold\">from</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'ember-data/attr'</span>;\r\n<span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">import</span> <span style=\"color: #0e84b5;font-weight: bold\">ModelBase</span> <span style=\"color: #0e84b5;font-weight: bold\">from</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'open-event-frontend/models/base'</span>;\r\n<span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">import</span> { belongsTo } <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">from</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'ember-data/relationships'</span>;\r\n\r\nexport default ModelBase<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>extend({\r\n  subject    : attr(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'string'</span>),\r\n  actionType : attr(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'string'</span>),\r\n  subjectId  : attr(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'number'</span>),\r\n  link       : attr(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'string'</span>),\r\n\r\n  notification: belongsTo(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'notification'</span>)\r\n});\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Action Button Title</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We make use of ember computed property to determine the action button title. The title of the button depends on the subject and the actionType defined in the notification-action model. The actionType can be one of ‘download’, ‘submit’ and ‘view’. If the action type is ‘download’ and the subject is ‘invoice’, then the button title will be “Download Invoice”. Similarly, for other cases, we do the same.</span></p>\n<p><!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\">buttonTitle: computed(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'subject'</span>, <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'actionType'</span>, function() {\r\n    let action;\r\n    const actionType <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> this<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>get(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'actionType'</span>);\r\n    switch (actionType) {\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'download'</span>:\r\n        action <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'Download'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'submit'</span>:\r\n        action <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'Submit'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      default:\r\n        action <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'View'</span>;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    let buttonSubject;\r\n    const subject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> this<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>get(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'subject'</span>);\r\n    switch (subject) {\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'event-export'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Event'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'event'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Event'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'invoice'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Invoice'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'order'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Order'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'tickets-pdf'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Tickets'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'event-role'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Invitation Link'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'session'</span>:\r\n        buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Session'</span>;\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      case <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'call-for-speakers'</span>:\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">if</span> (this<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>get(<span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'actionType'</span>) <span style=\"color: #333333\">===</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">'submit'</span>) {\r\n          buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Proposal'</span>;\r\n        } <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">else</span> {\r\n          buttonSubject <span style=\"color: #333333\">=</span> <span style=\"background-color: #fff0f0\">' Call for Speakers'</span>;\r\n        }\r\n        <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">break</span>;\r\n\r\n      default:\r\n        <span style=\"color: #333333\">//</span> Nothing here<span style=\"color: #333333\">.</span>\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    <span style=\"color: #008800;font-weight: bold\">return</span> action <span style=\"color: #333333\">+</span> buttonSubject;\r\n  })\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Action Button Route</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The route that the button will lead to depends on the subject of the action.

style=\"text-align: center\"> Figure 2.  Showing CAP pins in PSLab</p>\n<p>For measuring capacitance in PSLab we use a specific method in which we supply a constant current to the CAP pin and thus we charge the capacitor to the maximum level, the math involved in it is as follow:-</p>\n<p>We know that</p>\n<p><b><i>Q{charge stored} = C*V</i></b></p>\n<p>Also</p>\n<p><b><i>Q= I * time</i></b></p>\n<p>Where</p>\n<p><b><i>I=current (constant)</i></b></p>\n<p>Thus the capacitance</p>\n<p><b><i>C = Q / V </i></b></p>\n<p>Therefore</p>\n<p><b><i>C = I*time / V (measured). &#8211; (1)</i></b></p>\n<p>Therefore we know the current supplied, we know the voltage measured and we have also set the time to charge the capacitor and thus we get the capacitance from equation (1).</p>\n<p><b>Code implementation for measuring capacitance</b></p>\n<p>This is the primary code for getting the data for measuring capacitance in which we pass the current range and the current time through which the data gets fetched from the device which is then further processed in another function in which we finally get the capacitance.</p>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color:

It offers features for events with several tracks and venues. The Event organizers may add orders on behalf of others and accept payments onsite. This blog post goes over the implementation of the onsite attendee feature in the Open Event Server.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Route</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Normally we expect the payload for a POST request of order to contain already created attendees also. In this case we want to create the attendees internally inside the server. Hence we need some way to differentiate between the two types of orders. The most basic and easy to implement option is to use a query parameter to specify if the attendees are onsite or not. We use </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">?onsite=true </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in order to specify that the attendees are onsite and hence should be created internally.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the POST request, we check if the query parameters contains the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">onsite</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> param as true or not.

This blogs will give a brief description of the channel communication error and how was it solved by me.</p>\n<p>In the previous blog I have discussed about the channel communication of PSLab and how it works. In this blog i will be discussing about the channel communication error which was occuring while using CH1 and CH2 pins of PSLab android.</p>\n<p><b>Communication between PSLab device and Android App</b></p>\n<p>As discussed in the previous blog the communication between the PSLab and the android occurs with the help of the USBManger class of android.</p>\n<p>One of the major function which makes it possible is the bulk transfer function of the android</p>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color: #a9b7c6;background: #282b2e none repeat scroll 0% 0%;padding: 0.5em\"><span class=\"hljs-attr\">amtWritten</span> = mConnection.bulkTransfer(mWriteEndpoint, src, written, writeLength, timeoutMillis);</pre>\n<p>As shown in the above code, there is a timeout that some time required for this function to be executed, and otherwise this function will return a negative value which will mean that the communication is not successful.</p>\n<p><b>Voltage Measuring Functions</b></p>\n<p>The main function which gets called while pressing the button for measuring voltage is the getVoltage function which simultaneously calls the volmeterAutoRange function as well as the getAverage voltage function. The voltageAutoRnge function also calls the getAverage function inside of it.</p>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color: #a9b7c6;background: #282b2e none repeat scroll 0% 0%;padding: 0.5em\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">public</span> double getVoltage(String channelName, Integer sample) {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.voltmeterAutoRange(channelName);\r\n    double Voltage = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.getAverageVoltage(channelName, sample);\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">if</span> (channelName.equals(<span class=\"hljs-string\" style=\"color: #6a8759\">\"CH3\"</span>)) {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">return</span> Voltage;\r\n    } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">else</span> {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">2</span> * Voltage;\r\n    }\r\n}</pre>\n<p>Calling both these functions simultaneously results in calling of the bulktranfer method</p>\n<p>VoltmeterAutoRange function:-</p>\n<pre class=\"hljs\" style=\"color: #a9b7c6;background: #282b2e none repeat scroll 0% 0%;padding: 0.5em\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">private</span> double voltmeterAutoRange(String channelName) {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">if</span> (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.analogInputSources.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">get</span>(channelName).gainPGA == <span class=\"hljs-number\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">0</span>)\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">0</span>;\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.setGain(channelName, <span class=\"hljs-number\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">0</span>, <span class=\"hljs-literal\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">true</span>);\r\n    double V = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.getAverageVoltage(channelName, <span class=\"hljs-literal\" style=\"color: #6897bb\">null</span>);\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\" style=\"color: #cc7832\">this</span>.autoSelectRange(channelName, V);\r\n}</pre>\n<p>The getAverage voltage function calls the getRawableVoltage function which thus calls the USBManger class functions of read and write, thus calling the bulkTranfer function.</p>\n<p>Thus as the bulk transfer function is called simultaneously it caused problem in communication.</p>\n<p><b>Solving the issue</b></p>\n<p>The communication related  issues were finally solved when these bugs were spotted, the solution to this issue is that the voltageAutoRange function’s return value was never used in the codes and was thus not required.[2]The voltageAutoRange function was calling the getAverageVoltage function just to get a return value.

The system supports two inbuilt roles namely Admin and Super Admin. The users having access to permissions panel can create new custom system roles and define set of panel permissions for them. Also the users are provided with the option of editing and deleting any system role except the two inbuilt system roles. The feature is implemented using custom-system-roles and panel-permissions API on the server.</p>\n<h2><b>Adding route for system-roles</b></h2>\n<p>The route for custom-system-system roles is defined which contains a model returning user permissions, system roles and the panel permissions. The model is defined as async so that the execution is paused while fetching the data from the store by adding the await expression.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\">async model() {\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">return</span> {\r\n   userPermissions  : await <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'store'</span>).findAll(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'user-permission'</span>),\r\n   systemRoles      : await <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'store'</span>).findAll(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'custom-system-role'</span>),\r\n   panelPermissions : await <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'store'</span>).findAll(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'panel-permission'</span>)\r\n };\r\n},\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>The route created above gets all the data for user permissions, system-roles and panel permissions which is later used by the template for rendering of data.</p>\n<h2><b>Adding model for system-roles and panel-permissions</b></h2>\n<p>The model for system-roles is created which contains the ‘name’ attribute of type string and a relationship with panel permissions. Every system role can have multiple panel permissions, therefore a hasMany relationship is defined in the model.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">export</span> <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">default</span> ModelBase.extend({\r\n name: attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'string'</span>),\r\n\r\n panelPermissions: hasMany(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'panelPermission'</span>)\r\n});\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>Similarly, the model for panel-permissions is added to the models directory.

The action for adding, updating and deleting system roles are defined in the controller. While adding the system roles, all the panels are fetched and checked which panel permissions are selected by the admin. A special property namely ‘isChecked’ is added to every panel permission checkbox which toggles on change. If the property is set true the corresponding panel is added to the panel permissions relationship of corresponding role. If no panel is selected, an error message to select atleast one panel is displayed.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\">deleteSystemRole(role) {\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.set(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'isLoading'</span>, <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">true</span>);\r\n role.destroyRecord()\r\n  ...\r\n  <span style=\"color: #008000\">// Notify success or failure</span>\r\n},\r\naddSystemRole() {\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.set(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'isLoading'</span>, <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">true</span>);\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">let</span> panels = <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'panelPermissions'</span>);\r\n\r\n panels.forEach(panel =&gt; {\r\n   <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">if</span> (panel.isChecked) {\r\n     <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'role.panelPermissions'</span>).addObject(panel);\r\n   } <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">else</span> {\r\n     <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'role.panelPermissions'</span>).removeObject(panel);\r\n   }\r\n });\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">if</span> (!<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'role.panelPermissions'</span>).length) {\r\n  <span style=\"color: #008000\">// Notification to select atleast one panel</span>\r\n } <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">else</span> {\r\n   <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'role'</span>).save()\r\n    <span style=\"color: #008000\">// Notify success or failure</span>\r\n }\r\n},\r\nupdatePermissions() {\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.set(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'isLoading'</span>, <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">true</span>);\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'model.userPermissions'</span>).save()\r\n  ...\r\n  <span style=\"color: #008000\">// Notify success or failure</span>\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>The actions defined above in the controller can be used in template by passing the appropriate parameters if required.

The model contains the attributes like canDelete, canUpdate, canCreate, canRead and the relationship with event role and the service.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">export</span> <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">default</span> ModelBase.extend({\r\n canDelete : attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'boolean'</span>),\r\n canUpdate : attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'boolean'</span>),\r\n canCreate : attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'boolean'</span>),\r\n canRead   : attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'boolean'</span>),\r\n\r\n role        : belongsTo(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'role'</span>),\r\n service     : belongsTo(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'service'</span>),\r\n serviceName : computed.alias(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'service.name'</span>)\r\n});\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>The above defined model ensures that every permission belongs to a role and service. An alias is declared in the model using the computed property which is later used in the controller to sort the permissions according to service name in lexicographical order.</p>\n<h2><b>Adding route for event roles</b></h2>\n<p>The route for event role is created which contains model returning an object containing the list of roles, services and permissions. The model is defined as async so that the execution is paused while fetching the data from the store by adding the await expression.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">export</span> <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">default</span> Route.extend({\r\n titleToken() {\r\n   <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">return</span> <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'l10n'</span>).t(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Event Roles'</span>);\r\n },\r\n async model() {\r\n   <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">return</span> {\r\n     roles       : [<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Attendee'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Co-organizer'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Moderator'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Organizer'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Track Organizer'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'Registrar'</span>],\r\n     services    : await <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'store'</span>).query(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'service'</span>, {}),\r\n     permissions : await <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>.get(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'store'</span>).query(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'event-role-permission'</span>, { <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'page[size]'</span>: 30 })\r\n   };\r\n }\r\n});\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>The route created above queries the data for roles, services and permissions which is later used by the template for rendering of the data obtained.</p>\n<h2><b>Adding controller for event roles</b></h2>\n<p>The controller for event roles is added to the controllers/admin/permissions directory.

Every role is fetched from the model and added to the template, all the permissions in sorted order are obtained from the controller and matched with the current role name. The relationship of permissions with role is used to check if its title is equal to the the current role.

Earlier it supported the download of list-view only, now it provides the support to download calendar-view as well. The problem incurred while downloading the calendar-view was that the view gets cropped due to limitations with the library used for PDF generation, thus only some parts of the calendar remained in the PDF. The problem is resolved by creating an image for every date in the schedule and adding the generated image to the PDF.</p>\n<h2><b>Selecting and adding the data for PDF generation</b></h2>\n<p>The data to be added to PDF depending on the filters and date-selectors applied is chosen from the DOM. Selection of data is done by looping through all the dates and adding only the ones which do not have ‘hide’ class added to them. The selected dates are first expanded such that their complete view is available while generating the image. The complete data is stored in a variable depending on if the complete schedule is requested for download or some filter is applied, which is later used for generating the image.<br />\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --></p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff;overflow: auto;width: auto;border: solid gray;border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em;padding: .2em .6em\">\n<pre style=\"margin: 0;line-height: 125%\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">let</span> fullScheduler = <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">true</span>;\r\n<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">let</span> mapValue = <span style=\"color: #a31515\">''</span>;\r\n\r\npdf = <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">new</span> jsPDF(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'l'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'pt'</span>, <span style=\"color: #a31515\">'a1'</span>);\r\n$(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'.calendar'</span>).each(<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">function</span>() {\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">let</span> hidePresent = $(<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>).attr(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'class'</span>).split(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">' '</span>).indexOf(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'hide'</span>) &lt;= 0;\r\n\r\n <span style=\"color: #0000ff\">if</span> (hidePresent) {\r\n   $timeline = $(<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>);\r\n\r\n  <span style=\"color: #008000\">// Expanding the schedule for current date</span>\r\n  ...\r\n  ...\r\n }\r\n fullScheduler = hidePresent &amp;&amp; fullScheduler;\r\n});\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">if</span>(fullScheduler) {\r\n $timeline = $(<span style=\"color: #a31515\">'.calendar'</span>).parent();\r\n mapValue = $timeline.children();\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<h2><b>Adding the notification while generating the PDF</b></h2>\n<p>A loader with the notification is added to provide better user experience, as the PDF generation takes place at the time of request itself it may take some time depending on the size of the schedule.

The organizer is required to generate an API key and client ID on Google developers console and add the generated credentials to web app generator. The credentials are added to the generated application and every session is added with an Add to calendar button, which on click makes the request to add the corresponding session to the calendar.</p>\n<h2><b>Creating Client ID and API key</b></h2>\n<p>Enable the Google calendar API from Google developers console. Go to `Create Credentials` tab and generate an API key and client ID for your app. While creating the client ID, an input field is present which requires Authorised javascript origins, mention the domains where the generated application would be deployed.</p>\n<h2><b>Adding Client ID and API key to the generator</b></h2>\n<p>The Client ID and API key obtained from the developer console is added to the web app generator.

Whenever the delete operation is performed, the selected images are moved to the Trash Bin and the user has the option to either delete the photos permanently or restoring back the deleted photos by navigating to the Trash bin section. So in this post, I’d be discussing the implementation of permanently deleting image/images from the Trashbin.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Firstly, we need to add permanent delete option in the popup menu provided in the itemview in the TrashView section. Every item in the Trashbin section displays a popup menu with two options-restore and delete permanently. The permanent delete option has been implemented in the itemview by adding the following lines of code.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;?xml version=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;1.0&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> encoding=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;utf-8&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">?&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;menu xmlns:android=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> xmlns:app=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> &lt;item</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     android:id=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@+id/delete_permanently&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     android:title=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@string/delete_permanently&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     app:showAsAction=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;never&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> /&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;/menu&gt;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>\n<b>Step 2</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now when the user opts to permanently delete any photo from the bin, a function </span><b>deletePermanent</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> would be invoked passing-in the trashbin object corresponding to the selected item as the parameter. Inside the deletePermanent method, a check is performed to determine whether the corresponding image file exists or not using the </span><b>.exists</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> method of the </span><b>File </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">class and if the result is true the file is deleted permanently using the .delete method of the </span><b>File </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">class. The method deletePermanent returns a boolean value depending on whether the image file is deleted permanently from the storage or not. The code snippets used to implement the deletePermanent method is provided below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">private</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">boolean</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">deletePermanent</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(TrashBinRealmModel trashBinRealmModel){</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">boolean</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> succ = </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">false</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   String path = trashBinRealmModel.getTrashbinpath();</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   File file = </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">new</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;/&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> + </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;.nomedia&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">//File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + &#8220;/&#8221; + &#8220;TrashBin&#8221;);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">if</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(file.exists()){</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       File file1 = </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">new</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> File(path);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">if</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(file1.exists()){</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">           succ = file1.delete();</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       }</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   }</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">return</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> succ;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">}</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>\n<b>Step 3</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The function deletePermanent used implemented in the previous step returns a boolean value which will be used in this step. So if the deletePermanent method returns true indicating that the image has been deleted from the trashbin, first a method </span><b>deleteFromRealm </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is invoked passing-in the path of the image in the Trashbin to delete the corresponding image’s record from the realm database. Thereafter, that particular trashbin item is removed from the ArrayList&lt;TrashbinRealmModel&gt; populating the TrashBin adapter to display the items in the TrashBin Activity and the adapter is notified of this change by the use of </span><b>NotifyItemRemoved</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><b>NotifyItemRangeChanged</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> methods of the RecyclerView adapter class passing-in the position of the item as parameter to the former and position along with the size of the updated list as parameters to the latter function. After the adapter is updated about the change in the dataset, the adapter re-populates the recyclerview thus displaying the remaining items in the trashbin section. The code snippets implementing the above-mentioned operations are provided below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">if</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(deletePermanent(trashBinRealmModel)){</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   deleteFromRealm(trashItemsList.get(position).getTrashbinpath());</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   trashItemsList.remove(position);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   notifyItemRemoved(position);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   notifyItemRangeChanged(position, trashItemsList.size());</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">}</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span>private </span><span>void</span> <span>deleteFromRealm</span><span>(</span><span>final</span><span> String path){</span><span><br />\n</span><span>   Realm realm = Realm.getDefaultInstance();</span><span><br />\n</span><span>   realm.executeTransaction(</span><span>new</span><span> Realm.Transaction() {</span><span><br />\n</span><span>       </span><span>@Override</span> <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>execute</span><span>(Realm realm) {</span><span><br />\n</span><span>           RealmResults&lt;TrashBinRealmModel&gt; trashBinRealmModels = realm.where(TrashBinRealmModel.class).equalTo</span><span><br />\n</span><span>                   (</span><span>&#8220;trashbinpath&#8221;</span><span>, path).findAll();</span><span><br />\n</span><span>           trashBinRealmModels.deleteAllFromRealm();</span><span><br />\n</span><span>       }</span><span><br />\n</span><span>   });</span><span><br />\n</span><span>}</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is how we have implemented the functionality to permanently delete an image from the Trashbin section in the Phimpme Android application.

However, another important functionality that has been implemented is the option to compress an image. Two modes of compress operation have been implemented namely compress by size and compress by dimensions. In the previous blog post I discussed the implementation of compress by size operation. So in this blog post, I will be discussing how we achieved the functionality to compress any image by resolution.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, we need to add an option in the bottombar menu(in the SingleMediaActivity) to </span><b>compress </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the image being viewed. The option to compress an image has been added by implementing the following lines of code in the  menu_bottom_view_pager.xml file.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;item</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:id=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@+id/action_compress&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:orderInCategory=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;2&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       app:showAsAction=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;always&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:icon=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@drawable/compressicn&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:title=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;Compress&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">/&gt;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><b>Step 2</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now on selecting the compress option, the user would be prompted to choose the compress mode i.e compress by size or compress by dimension.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once the user opts for compressing the image by resolution, a dialog containing the various resolutions options to choose from is to be displayed. Code snippets used to implement the dialog along with seekbar is displayed below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:

However, another important functionality that has been implemented is the option to compress an image. Two modes of compress operation have been implemented namely compress by size and compress by dimensions. So in this blog post, I will be discussing how we achieved the functionality to compress any image by size.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, we need to add an option in the bottom bar menu(in the SingleMediaActivity) to </span><b>compress </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the image being viewed. The option to compress an image has been added by implementing the following lines of code in the  menu_bottom_view_pager.xml file.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;item</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:id=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@+id/action_compress&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:orderInCategory=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;2&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       app:showAsAction=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;always&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:icon=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@drawable/compressicn&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       android:title=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;Compress&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">/&gt;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><b>Step 2</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now on selecting the compress option, the user would be prompted to choose the compress mode i.e compress by size or compress by dimension. Once the user has opted for the size mode a dialog with a seekbar to set the compress percentage is to be displayed. Code snippets used to implement the dialog along with seekbar is displayed below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;RelativeLayout</span><span

</span><a href=\"https://github.com/zetbaitsu/Compressor\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Compressor</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. After the user has set the compress percentage, the </span><b>Compressor</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> class of the library is instantiated by passing-in the context as the parameter and some of its functions are invoked simultaneously. The functions invoked are setQuality(), setCompressFormat(), setDestinationDirectoryPath(), compressToFile(). </span></p>\n<p><b>setQuality(int) </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8211; to set the percentage compressed.</span></p>\n<p><b>setCompressFormat(Bitmap.CompressFormat) </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8211; to determine the format of the output compressed image.</span></p>\n<p><b>setDestinationDirectoryPath(File) </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8211; to specify the path to which the compressed image is to be saved.</span></p>\n<p><b>compressToFile(File) </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8211; to perform the compress operation, passing-in the file object of the corresponding image to be compressed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The compressToFile() function performs the final compress operation and saves the compressed image to the specified path.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Code snippets to implement the above-mentioned operations are given below</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:

So in this blog post, I will be discussing the undo operation option implemented for the delete image feature in Phimpme Android app. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Firstly, we need to add an “Undo” action button in the Snackbar that displays the success operation message. With this addition, the user would have time to undo an operation until the snackbar message is being displayed on the screen. The undo action button can be added to the Snackbar by the use of the </span><b>setAction</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> method of the Snackbar class. The code snippets used to implement the button is provided below</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Snackbar snackbar = SnackBarHandler.showWithBottomMargin2(mDrawerLayout, String.valueOf(no) + </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8221; &#8220;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> + getString(R.string</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">               .trashbin_move_onefile),</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       navigationView.getHeight</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">               (), Snackbar.LENGTH_SHORT);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">snackbar.setAction(</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;UNDO&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">new</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> View.OnClickListener() {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">@Override</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">public</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">void</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">onClick</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(View view) {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       getAlbum().moveAllMedia(getApplicationContext(), getAlbum().getPath(), media1);</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       refreshListener.onRefresh();</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   }</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">});</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">snackbar.show();</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>\n<b>Step 2</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the user performs the delete operation, first the photos are moved to the trashbin and the user have the option to delete them from there. Now, if the user opts for undo operation, on clicking the undo button the function moveallMedia will be invoked passing-in context, the path of the current album and an ArrayList&lt;Media&gt; containing the deleted media on which the undo operation is to be performed upon, as parameters. Here the ArrayList&lt;Media&gt; passed as a parameter contains the trashbin paths of the images deleted by the previous action. A method storeDeletedFilesTemporarily has been used that returns the list containing the deleted images trashbin paths. The implementation of the method storeDeletedFilesTemporarily has been provided below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>private ArrayList&lt;Media&gt; storeDeletedFilesTemporarily(){<br />\nArrayList&lt;Media&gt; deletedImages = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();<br />\nif(!all_photos &amp;&amp; !fav_photos &amp;&amp; editMode){<br />\nfor(Media m: getAlbum().getSelectedMedia()){<br />\nString name = m.getPath().substring(m.getPath().lastIndexOf(&#8220;/&#8221;) + 1);<br />\ndeletedImages.add(new Media(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + &#8220;/&#8221; + &#8220;.nomedia&#8221; + &#8220;/&#8221; + name));<br />\n}<br />\n} else if(all_photos &amp;&amp; !fav_photos &amp;&amp; editMode){<br />\nfor(Media m: selectedMedias){<br />\nString name = m.getPath().substring(m.getPath().lastIndexOf(&#8220;/&#8221;) + 1);<br />\ndeletedImages.add(new Media(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + &#8220;/&#8221; + &#8220;.nomedia&#8221; + &#8220;/&#8221; + name));<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\nreturn deletedImages;<br />\n}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>\n<b>Step 3</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now in the final step, I’d discuss the implementation of the moveAllMedia method that actually completes the undo operation. As I mentioned earlier that on performing the delete operation the images are moved to the bin folder(which is hidden from the other applications), so the moveAllMedia method here will again move the images from the trashbin folder to the current folder. With this operation deleted images would be stored back to their original folder and their trashbin record would be simultaneously deleted from the Realm database. The code implementation of the moveAllMedia method is provided below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">public</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">int</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">moveAllMedia</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Context context, String targetDir, ArrayList&lt;Media&gt;

Whenever the delete operation is performed, the selected images are moved to the Trash Bin and the user has the option to either delete the photos permanently or restoring back the deleted photos by navigating to the Trash bin section. So, in this post I’d be discussing the implementation of restore image/images functionality.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Firstly, we need to add restore option in the popup menu provided in the itemview in the TrashView section. Every item in the Trashbin section displays a popup menu with two options-restore and delete permanently. The popup menu along with the two options have been implemented by adding the following lines of code.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;?xml version=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;1.0&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> encoding=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;utf-8&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">?&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;menu xmlns:android=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> xmlns:app=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> &lt;item</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     android:id=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@+id/restore_option&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     android:title=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@string/restore_photo&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     app:showAsAction=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;never&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> /&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> &lt;item</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     android:id=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@+id/delete_permanently&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     android:title=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;@string/delete_permanently&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">     app:showAsAction=</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;never&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> /&gt;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&lt;/menu&gt;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><b>Step 2</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now after the user opts to restore a particular image, the corresponding realm object for the image would be retrieved from the Realm database. This realm object would contain attributes namely trashbinpath, oldpath, datetime, timeperiod. Here the oldpath attribute contains the path where it  was stored in the device storage before the delete operation was performed on the image. Thereafter to restore the image to its old path, a move operation would be performed which would move the image from the TrashBin section to the album it was stored in before deletion. With this move operation, the image is restored to its old path and is visible in the respective album resulting in the removal/deletion of the image from the TrashBin section. The method implemented to perform the above mentioned operations is provided below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">private</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">boolean</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">restoreImage</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(TrashBinRealmModel trashBinRealmModel){</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   String oldpath = trashBinRealmModel.getOldpath();</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">boolean</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> success = </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">false</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">try</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       String from = trashBinRealmModel.getTrashbinpath();</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">if</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (success = moveMedia(context, from, targetDir)) {</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">           scanFile(context, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">new</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> String[]{ from, StringUtils.getPhotoPathMoved(pathofmed, targetDir) });</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">       }</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   } </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">catch</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">return</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> success;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">}</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><b>Step 3</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the previous step, the move operation for the restore feature was performed by the restoreImage method which inturn uses method moveMedia() to get the job done. So in this step, I’d be discussing about the implementation of the moveMedia() method. Inside the moveMedia() method, moveFile method of ContentHelper class is invoked passing-in context, sourcefile, and the destination folder as the parameters. Thereafter a normal rename operation is performed by the use of the renameTo method to move the file to destination folder.

Mobile network operators, donors, development partners, technology companies and startups all convene to engage in thought provoking conversations and showcase innovations that can take Africa to the next level of technology advancement.</p>\n<p>The recent Mobile 360 Africa series was held in the land of a thousand hills: Rwanda. Hosted at the Kigali Convention Centre, I had the privilege of having a one-on-one fireside chat with Phillip Amoateng, the phenomenal advocate for mobile internet skills in Airtel CEO for Rwanda.</p>\n<p>The fireside chat, <strong>‘Digital Inclusion: The role of the operator in Africa,’</strong> took place during the session <strong>‘Is the Digital Landscape Inclusive for All.’</strong> In this increasingly connected and digital world, consumers are using a wide range of mobile-enabled services for education, agriculture, health, finance and utilities. But despite significant growth in mobile usage across developed regions, in low- and middle-income countries, certain segments of society are being left behind: women, individuals with less education, rural residents, and the poor account for a disproportionate number of those not connected.</p>\n<p>Over the years, we have seen increased investments in infrastructure and growth of mobile subscriptions. But it’s not just infrastructure that needs continued investments – users still exhibit limited user capabilities, with most adults in low- and middle-income countries not having basic digital skills and competences. Across Africa, seven in ten people who do not use the internet say they just don’t know how to use it. Even in Europe, 19 percent of adults lack the literacy skills, and 45 percent lack the basic digital skills, needed to function fully in a modern society. Interestingly, women are 1.6 times more likely than men to report lack of digital skills as a factor limiting their use of the internet.</p>\n<p>Thus, it was interesting to learn from Phillip about the strides that Airtel Rwanda has taken in enhancing mobile internet skills training in a quest to enhance the ability of users to use basic internet applications, understand internet bundles and how to check balances.</p>\n<p>On the Mobile Internet Skills Training pilot that Airtel conducted in Rwanda, which reached a quarter of a million subscribers with 300 agents, Phillip said it was encouraging to see first-time internet users discover the value of internet based applications. Tigo sales agents were trained by Airtel/Tigo staff, who then in turn, trained customers that visited their shops.</p>\n<p><strong><em>“We learned that customers once taught, would create a ripple effect by training other community embers within their circle.”</em></strong></p>\n<p>And the benefit of creating a learning environment is transformative.</p>\n<p><strong><em>“Being internet literate is not just about being online but also being available for opportunities. Apart from being in constant contact with friends and families there are also economic benefits and opportunities such as new and better jobs. We highlight the value of the internet as a means of enhancing opportunities for jobs, learning, and business, and more.”</em></strong></p>\n<p>We also discussed the roles MNOs can play in addressing challenges of affordability and digital skills training. MNOs can leverage partnerships with education institutions and non-formal education structures to enhance mobile internet skills training. With increasing smart phone penetration, apps will make learning internet skills easier.</p>\n<p>As I left the Better Future Stage having had such an insightful conversation with Phillip, I wondered what would happen if all mobile network operators integrated mobile internet skills training for mobile users, particularly those within the low literacy bracket. The number of digitally illiterate Africans would drastically reduce and create more opportunities for communication, learning, jobs and businesses. The future of mobile internet is vast and it’s up to us to make sure everyone is included in its benefits.</p>\n<p>See the GSMA report on the Mobile Internet Skills Training Toolkit <a href=\"https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/connected-society/mistt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/cross-post-digital-inclusion-the-role-of-the-mobile-network-operator-in-africa/\">CROSS-POST: Digital Inclusion: The Role of the Mobile Network Operator in Africa</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org\">DIAL</a>.</p>\n","published":"2018-08-23T18:05:06.000Z","author":"Rachel Sibande","link":"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/cross-post-digital-inclusion-the-role-of-the-mobile-network-operator-in-africa/","feed":{"source":"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/feed/","link":"https://digitalimpactalliance.org","name":"DIAL"}},{"title":"Naveen Kumar Sangi: The Gopher way","content":"<p>My journey from Python to Golang via Node.js</p><p>Ever since college, I dabbled with Python, made a few scripts here and there, built some websites with Flask and Django. It was the first language I referred to anyone because it was quite easy to start with and delivers amazing results to the developers in no time. Although it was quite a break from having to program in C and Java, the language felt lacking in some of the most important areas.</p><h3>The deal breaker</h3><p>Now came Node.js into my life and I began experimenting with concurrency patterns. Backend JavaScript? Who would take that seriously? At best, it seemed like a new attempt to make server-side development easier at the cost of performance, scalability, etc. Maybe it’s just my ingrained developer skepticism, but there’s always been that alarm that goes off in my brain when I read about something being fast and easy and production-level.</p><p>Node.js became my go to language for a very long time. I got used to the latest programming syntaxes with using ES7 in the client side of things. The single threaded node event-loop made miracles possible for me, without severing any kind of performance and being cheap to use. As time passed, I began a deeper dive into the world of npm modules and the architecture of Node.js. It is a magical space filled with unicorns and rainbows.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*In5xU4obN2qlDEMAyPwg_w.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Performance at it’s best?</figcaption></figure><p>Most developers have heard about Node’s non-blocking I/O model; it’s great because it means all requests are handled asynchronously without blocking execution, or incurring any overhead (like with threads and processes) and as the developer you can be blissfully unaware what’s happening in the backend. However, it’s always important to keep in mind that Node is single-threaded which means none of your code runs in parallel. I/O may not block the server but your code certainly does. If you call sleep for 5 seconds, your server will be unresponsive during that time. But my actual problem came with JavaScript. I know most of you will feel this like a rant and there are ways to solve this problem. Please, just bear with me through this.</p><p>When people were developing JavaScript, they wanted it to do all sorts of things and serve every other purpose. It all started with those thoughts, which made it kind of messy. Determining boolean outcomes in plain old JavaScript is hard.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TdKBZcFORJk1sMuKmELNTw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>True? False? Confused all in all.</figcaption></figure><pre>// all true</pre><pre>1 == '1';<br />1 == [1];<br />'1' == [1];</pre><pre>// all false</pre><pre>1 === '1';<br />1 === [1];<br />'1' === [1];</pre><p>The internal type system of JavaScript is a mixed bag with six different types which causes all sorts of havoc to the end user.</p><ul><li>Undefined (a variable with no defined value)</li><li>Null (a single null value)</li><li>Boolean (true or false)</li><li>Number (this includes Infinity and NaN – not a number!)</li><li>String (textual data)</li><li>Symbol (a unique and immutable primitive new to ES6/2015)</li></ul><p>I know there are ways to sort out these issues effectively, but a language experiencing these sorts of mutability can be problematic to users who are new to JavaScript world.</p><p>Then comes callback hell and having to deal with Promises and all in all the new keywords async and await . I always had retrospection over my language choices and it became very clear that I need strong typing and I can’t live without it. I tried TypeScript but it seemed a bit too expressive to start with.</p><h3>The Second Deal Breaker</h3><p>My main requirements for a language were speed, reliability, built-in concurrency patterns, a strong type system, garbage collection and lots of tooling. It’s not until recent times that I felt the need for all this stuff. I heard rumours earlier about Google building a new language that is going to change the world. True to the naming, it really brought about some deal breaking changes. Here’s a list of things I like about Go and why you’ll love it too.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*L3wZZlN4wBjuF-W1vLfhCw.jpeg\" /><figcaption><strong>go get -u programmer.life/success</strong></figcaption></figure><h4>Opinionated</h4><p>Yes, it is very opinionated. But, I love the way of doing things in one way. With Golang, to do something, there’s just one way of doing it. The official tooling built around Go ensures that we do follow the one way.</p><h4>Goroutines</h4><p>The first half of Go’s concurrency paradigms. Lightweight, concurrent function execution. You can spawn tons of these if needed and the Go runtime multiplexes them onto the configured number of CPUs/Threads as needed. They start with a super small stack that can grow (and shrink) via dynamic allocation (and freeing). They are as simple as go f(x), where f() is a function.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_c9Ob50Cdmh09wLSzHRKgQ.png\" /><figcaption>I am strong. Because my dad wanted me to be.</figcaption></figure><h4>Channels</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/425/1*H2Qh0oiHP64TkG4-Nnjtng.png\" /></figure><p>The other half of Go’s concurrency story. Channels are a typed conduit used to send and receive values. These are used to pass values to and from Goroutines for processing. They are by default unbuffered, meaning synchronous and blocking. They can also be buffered, allowing values to queue up inside of them for processing. Multiple go routines can read/write to them at the same time without having to take locks. Go also has primitives for reading from multiple channels simultaneously via the select statement.</p><h4>Compiled Static Binaries</h4><p>Go compiles your program into a <strong>static binary</strong>. Yep, you heard it right. A <strong>static binary</strong>. This makes deployment really simple. Just copy the binary and it should be good to go. No pip install, no virtualenv, no freaking npm install . All of that is handled at compile time.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*BES005dHRZzV4WBtA7XV7Q.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Binaries defeat all!</figcaption></figure><h4>Cross Compilation</h4><p>This is too good to be true. But it is. Yes. Golang allows cross compilation. Ever wanted to test your program on Windows but you use Linux? No more installing compilation tools and building it again on windows. Simply, use GOOS=windows and you can compile it on a Mac or a Linux machine. It even allows changing the architecture of the platform with GOARCH . There’s a laundry list of available platforms and OSes. You can find the list <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/asukakenji/f15ba7e588ac42795f421b48b8aede63\">here</a>.</p><h4>Runtime</h4><p>Go is a complied language, but still has a runtime. It handles all of the details of mallocing memory for you, allocating/deallocating space for variables, etc. Memory used by variables lasts as long as the variables are referenced, which is usually the scope of a function. Go has a garbage collector.</p><h4>Pass by Value</h4><p>“For the love of all holy Mary, please don’t bring back pointers.” And, well, yeah, they almost averted the crisis in the case of Golang. Everything is passed by value, but there are pointers. It’s just that the value of a pointer is a memory location, so it acts as pass by reference. This means that, by default, there is no shared state between functions. But, you can pass a pointer if you desire/need it for performance/memory utilization reasons. Go does the right thing by default, but doesn’t shackle you. Oh, and there isn’t any pointer math, so you won’t screw yourself with it. As pointed out on <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5196498\">HN</a>, you can do pointer math with the <a href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/\">“unsafe”</a> package and unsafe.Pointer.</p><h4>Type System</h4><p>Go has structs and interfaces. Go’s structs can have methods <em>associated</em> with them. Structs can be anonymously included in other structs to make the inside struct’s variables/methods available as part of the enclosting struct. Interfaces are sets of method signatures. Structs implement an interface by implementing the methods described by the interface definition. Functions can receive values by interface, like <a href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/KfKLiAClQE\">so</a>. The compiler checks all of this at compile time.</p><h4>Package System</h4><p>Or lack there of. Since Go compiles everything statically, you don’t have to worry about packages at runtime. But how do you include libraries into your code? Simply by importing them via url, like so: import \"github.com/bmizerany/pq\". Go’s tooling knows how to look that up and clone the repo. Also works with Mercurial, Bazaar &amp; Subversion. go get it, my boy.</p><h4>Anon. Functions &amp; Closures</h4><p>Go supports anonymous functions that can form closures. These functions can then be passed around and retain the environment under which they were created, like <a href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/4rYrqw4l7m\">so</a>. This can be super powerful when <a href=\"https://github.com/freeformz/filechan\">combined</a> with channels and go routines.</p><h4>Built in profiling</h4><p>It supports pprof as a part of the standard library. And with a <a href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/\">very small bit of work</a>, you can access profiling info via a http interface.</p><h4>Defer</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/340/1*9IyFa5ur0nALjTmnACHkGQ.png\" /><figcaption>I love to postpone work, yeah.</figcaption></figure><p>Ever forget to close a file descriptor or free some memory? So have the designers of Go. The reason for this is that you usually have to perform those actions far away from where the resources were opened/allocated. Go solves this problem with the defer statement. Each defer statement pushes a function/expression onto a stack that get’s executed in LIFO order after the enclosing function returns. This makes cleanup really easy, after opened a file, just defer file.Close().</p><h4>Comprehensive Standard Library</h4><p>Go’s <a href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/\">standard library</a> is pretty comprehensive.</p><h4>It’s Fast</h4><p>Go compiles down to native code and it does it fast. Usually in just a few seconds. No matter if you have a million package imports. It does compile in seconds. There’s a rumour that Golang actually came to life over a discussion developers had during a <em>code compilation</em> break.</p><h4>Comprehensive Tooling Out Of The Box</h4><p>Go do a go --help. Some of my favorites: go fmt, go doc, go fix go get go tool pprof&amp; go test.</p><h4>Straight Forward Testing</h4><p>Super <a href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/testing/\">straight foward</a>, no magic. And hell, yeah, it even has a <a href=\"https://blog.golang.org/race-detector\">race detector</a> that finds out all your runtime woes even before hitting production.</p><h4>Simple C Interface</h4><p>By using build directives you can integrate with C libraries really <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/freeformz/4552031\">easily</a>.</p><h4>Straight Forward Syntax / Standard Formatting</h4><p>The syntax is pretty simple, C like w/o all the crazy of C. But what’s really nice is go fmt, which re-writes your code into the Go standard format. No more arguments like tabs vs spaces or indentation rules! There’s just one way and you have to stick to it my friend.</p><h3>Golang’s Cons</h3><p>With all of that said, it’s not perfect…</p><h4>Runtime</h4><p>Go’s runtime is not super <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_does_Go_perform_badly_on_benchmark_x\">tuned</a> yet. By comparison the JVM has had over 18 years of development history behind it. But, for a 1.0.X runtime &amp; language, Go is pretty damn good.</p><h4>Garbage Collector</h4><p>Go programs can malloc a lot of ram at times, even when the program itself isn’t using much. Most of this shows up as VIRT though, so most linux systems just won’t care.</p><h4>1 CPU by default</h4><p>This is going to change over time, but the runtime will, by default, use only <a href=\"http://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_no_multi_CPU\">one CPU</a>.</p><p>I can bear with having a few cons. After all nothing is perfect in this world. I can live by knowing that there are a few disadvantages while using a language as long as they don’t affect programming like JavaScript’s falsity or callback hell.</p><img height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=681a70f3bc79\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/my-new-roots/the-gopher-way-681a70f3bc79\">The Gopher way</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/my-new-roots\">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","published":"2018-08-23T06:07:52.000Z","author":"","link":"https://medium.com/my-new-roots/the-gopher-way-681a70f3bc79?source=rss----3f7df00e1da2---4","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"Naveen Kumar Sangi: How Open Source turned my Life Around.","content":"<p>A short story on how things changed.</p><p>2017 was a massive year in my life as a developer. It brought about no small changes both in how I go about writing code as well as how I interact with other developers. The one thing that “<strong>matter</strong><em>ed the</em> <strong>most</strong>” is <strong>collaboration</strong>.<strong> 🙌</strong> It’s not just that open source development demands a greater degree of collaboration, but the acceleration of open source as a movement on all ends during the past few years has actually redefined how software development is done. It became a highly collaborative process with distributed version control systems everywhere. 🌍</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/620/1*v5o3JVZVH_74c8gl-k6Pmw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Open source ❤️</figcaption></figure><p>This totally changed the way I write code 💻 . To begin with, it has helped me <em>organise my development workflow</em>. For example, when I want to work on a bug fix or a new feature, I can <strong>branch</strong> off anytime. While <strong>Git</strong> has had an impact on how I personally write code, what has transformed software development into a truly collaborative process has been the rise of code hosting services such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\">Bitbucket</a> or <a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx\">Visual Studio Team Services</a>, which provide tools for implementing a collaboration <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow\">workflow</a> based on Git, with work isolated into branches, organized into commits and documented with commit messages.</p><p>Google Summer of Code 2017 was the one major thing in my life that totally changed it. 😇 I was initially only hoping to finish up the project to 💰 gain money. Only now do I understand that money is the least of the goodies from GSoC. To start with, it gave me new friends 👬 and connections. That is the huge part of the deal. Being a GSoC alumni, you can dive into any of the GSoC summits taking place everywhere in the world. Although I haven't attended any yet, I’m planning on visiting somewhere next year. I’m so thankful to my mentors for patiently <a href=\"https://medium.com/my-new-roots/we-all-have-bad-days-f59a334f0641\">bearing with me through GSoC</a>. Our interaction during the small period of three months brought about some of the most interesting changes in my life. I was offered a contract as a part time freelancer while still being in college. That moment when you really can pay your bills 🎉 was epic. I worked for almost an year of college and it never felt burdening as some of my friends said it would. 😏</p><p>Then comes Mozilla 🦊 into my life. 20th November 2017, marks the day we applied for Mozilla Open Source Support. We were initially so skeptical about the deal and were not sure how much our project aligns to Mozilla’s 🔐 privacy guidelines. Our product wasn’t much focused on privacy, so we had our doubts. We waited patiently through the first couple of months and then lost our hope gradually. But, miraculously, 😍 they reached out to us after five months with the news that I was awarded with the Mozilla Open Source Support Award 2017. By the time I was aware of the news, our project was halfway done. This really eased things up for me. Although the total period of the project was a whopping 12 months, we finished it up in almost half the time thanks to my enthusiastic mentors.</p><p>I never attended a college placement as I wasn’t keen on doing a full time job and wanted to continue as a freelancer. I also have plans for higher studies, so I didn’t want to pull myself into job woes 😩. Initially, I regretted my decision for not attending on-campus placements soon after I left college. Almost all of my friends were busy starting their new lives at companies. It felt so lonely and disturbing. That was the moment I decided to go full out on the search for a job. With about two years of open source record on my resume, it wasn’t that difficult to gain a job in the world outside of placements. I was contacted by atleast 20 companies in the span of a month and I started making choices. I attended 3 interviews and got selected 💃 in two of them. By the end of the month, I had two opportunities to choose from. Then, came my saviour, ❤️Lasse, one of my mentors from GSoC. He brought to me another opportunity to work with a community of people I’ve already known from GSoC. Imagine how refreshing 😍 it would feel to continue working with people whom you already love to work with. I dished out all other options and went with my mentor. I never had the thought that landing a job would be this effortless, provided you have good connections. And a GSoC really helped me get those good connections. I kind of hoped that “making choices” part would come to my life at some point. But, I never knew that it would be so early in life.

For the past 20 years now, one of the biggest of these gatherings of creators and consumers of open source software has been the O&#8217;Reilly Open Source Convention (<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or\">OSCON</a>). DIAL&#8217;s Open Source Center team just returned from the event in Portland, Oregon, and once again left informed and refreshed as open source enters its third decade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-16226 size-medium\" src=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-300x225.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-768x576.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>As Director of Community for the DIAL <a href=\"http://www.osc.dial.community/\">Open Source Center</a>, I primarily focus on the power of people to build technology to improve the reach and impact of international development and humanitarian response work, and to bring people in our field together to tackle new problems and find new ways to collaborate. That&#8217;s why the <a href=\"http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/\">Community Leadership Summit</a>, held each year just before OSCON, was particularly valuable this year. An &#8220;unconference&#8221;, the content of the event is driven by participants. I hosted the &#8220;Beyond Fiscal Sponsors&#8221; session, where experts honed in on the challenges and gaps faced by open source software projects and how organizations like DIAL and our Open Source Center can fill those gaps and amplify the impact of software projects &#8212; not only in the development &amp; humanitarian sectors, but also in all types of open source work.</p>\n<p>Two days of tutorials and in-depth workshops followed for the team, on topics from giving better technical presentations, to coaching engineering team members, to technology platforms like Kubernetes, containers, and continuous delivery. Finally, there were two days of keynotes and shorter technical talks, enabling us learn about the work of our open source colleagues around the world as the develop best practices.</p>\n<p>Of course, there were many exciting conve<a href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16228 alignright\" src=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-300x225.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-768x576.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>rsations for our team along the way. David McCann, the Center&#8217;s Director of Technology, sat down with O&#8217;Reilly Media to talk a little bit about the United Nations Foundation, DIAL, and how the Open Source Center is working to turbocharge projects in the international development space. Check out the interview <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPgekpgk2Uc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Throughout the weeklong event, the entire team &#8212; including the newest member of our team, Heath Arensen, was able to meet and brainstorm with key players in the tech industry about how we might adapt the lessons they&#8217;ve learned to build more financially sustainable open source software projects with long-lasting impact. We had great discussions sharing success stories and ideas for how to strengthen this invaluable effort to build even more technology capacity and launch more technology careers for women, people in the Global South, and other under-represented groups.</p>\n<p>On the final day of the week, I presented a talk about the DIAL Open Source Center, how open source software is being used in critical humanitarian and development world in every part of the world, and how we&#8217;re helping to mitigate some of the risk involved by providing additional resources and services to those projects.</p>\n<p>Conferences are major investments of time and energy, but the time spent on forging new relationships and partnerships, as well as teaching others about what we&#8217;ve learned, helps to increase the impact of every bit of work we do the rest of the year. Again this year, we were very grateful for the opportunity to be surrounding by thousands of our colleagues for such a vibrant and busy week.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/celebrating-20-years-of-open-source-at-oscon-2018/\">Celebrating 20 Years of Open Source at O&#8217;Reilly Open Source Convention</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org\">DIAL</a>.</p>\n","published":"2018-08-09T19:24:51.000Z","author":"Blog Moderator","link":"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/celebrating-20-years-of-open-source-at-oscon-2018/","feed":{"source":"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/feed/","link":"https://digitalimpactalliance.org","name":"DIAL"}},{"title":"Abinash Senapati: Flip bits, not burgers","content":"<p><a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/\"><img alt=\"Flip bits not burgers\" src=\"https://www.faveohelpdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/language-1000x507.jpg\" /></a></p>","published":"2018-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","author":"","link":"https://techievena.github.io/gsoc/2018/08/07/gsoc-submission.html","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"Staff Spotlight: DIAL Fellow Rebecca Winokur","content":"<p>When I moved to Vermont, I spent a year working as an AmeriCorps/VISTA volunteer on adult literacy, which was a powerful and eye-opening experience into the world of public health and vulnerable populations. It inspired me to go on to medical school, where I learned some important life skills like how to doze off standing up, deliver babies, and how to take on the honor of holding hands with people as they died. After residency I did a fellowship in sports medicine and developed a practice in that field. I continued to practice medicine part-time in urgent care while I moved on to work full-time in the for-profit health informatics industry.</p>\n<p>I found the informatics work fascinating, mostly because of the challenges and failures that persisted across practices and hospitals despite access to significant resources and infrastructure. It was surprising to me how much inefficiency and lack of interoperability there was, and most didn’t seem to know how to leverage technology for the sake of better outcomes. There was confusion among the actors around government standards and expectations, even among the governing bodies themselves. While this was my first exposure to challenges faced when integrating tech, it wouldn’t be my last. It’s frustrating to see the potential of technology not be realized in what otherwise seemed like an optimal health care setting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Me-and-my-boys.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16112 alignleft\" src=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Me-and-my-boys-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Me-and-my-boys-300x300.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Me-and-my-boys-150x150.jpg 150w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Me-and-my-boys-768x770.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Me-and-my-boys-50x50.jpg 50w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Me-and-my-boys-100x100.jpg 100w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Me-and-my-boys-500x500.jpg 500w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Me-and-my-boys.jpg 958w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>While I was practicing medicine, I was also starting a family. It was during this phase of my life when my career path solidified. When I first met my oldest son, he was 8 months old and living in an orphanage in Addis Ababa. I’ve since gotten to know his birth mom and her story about making the decision to relinquish him. While my younger son’s story is unique as he was several years older when we first me and from a different region of Ethiopia, his birth family faced similar life-changing challenges. Through our family and our Ethiopian family’s experiences, I was drawn to better understand how it could be that such loving families had to make this kind of heartbreaking decision.</p>\n<p>I began volunteering for an NGO that implements programming in Ethiopia, <a href=\"https://www.whfc.org/\">Wide Horizons For Children</a>, focused on reducing maternal and child morbidity and mortality, and empowering families. Many of their projects, which typically focus on health, education and financial stability, utilize digital technology for implementation. This may be in the form of using cell phones to access assessment tools to support health extension workers or data collection for school feeding programs. With limited funding and capacity, this NGO faced some of the same challenges I saw during my time in the for-profit informatics world. On their own, they can’t address their digital technology challenges in a way that would allow them to scale-up, innovate, leverage work from other sectors and reduce redundancy or achieve sustainability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Medical-Mission-003.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16115 alignright\" src=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Medical-Mission-003-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Medical-Mission-003-300x169.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Medical-Mission-003-768x432.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Medical-Mission-003.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>It’s from my experiences in these diverse settings that I’m so motivated and enthusiastic to embrace the work of DIAL. While here, I’m working on creating public facing documents on what we’ve been calling the Advanced Market Commitment vaccine research. This encompasses the work DIAL did with PATH that investigated the market-shaping mechanisms that changed the way vaccines were procured. It also includes new thinking from DIAL and the Tableau Foundation on drawing lessons learned that can expand access to digital markets. Stay tuned for the release of the research!

Image credits: Unsplash.com</figcaption></figure><p>It can be frustrating to to hear about how to make your life wonderful by doing things that you can’t necessarily do on a daily basis because of your job or lifestyle. I hear about people travelling all time to far flung places, or spending days outside, and the only thing that I can think of is how unfair it is that I’m cooped up in my home, with the only view of outside being the screen in front of me.</p><p>However, as someone like me who likes to make the most of each day, (not just weekends!), there are a few things I do to make even my most mundane Mondays a little brighter, because I’m a big believer that every day should be made ridiculously amazing!</p><h4>Get up an hour earlier.</h4><p>Yes. I know my friends. We all are insomniacs and stay up all night doing all kinds of things. But, do give it a try, an early sleep and early rise can truly fresh up your day a lot. Use the time to take a stroll down to a park or even just the sidewalk, if you don’t live near any park. Frantically running into showers, driving or walking to the office, and sitting at your desk before your body has even had time to adjust to your new day, only worsens your day. Set yourself a tone for the mellower day, instead.</p><h4>Make a to-do list in the morning.</h4><p>Thanks to few of my colleagues, I recently started writing up to-do lists at work. It feels so refreshing at the end of the day seeing all those check marks. To give it a try, I brought the same change to my life, not just work. It just feels too good to be true, that simple things like these really refresh your day. But this trick really does work.</p><h4>Make movement non-negotiable.</h4><p>Halfway through your morning and through the afternoon, I force myself to standup and walk around. (Couldn’t do that earlier, so, I forced my laptop to go to sleep, if I didn’t have a walk in time.) I’m trying to do this as often as possible. This helped me have a break from all the problems at work. Work is just work to get paid. It shouldn’t be haunting your afterlife.</p><h4>At lunch, get away from your computer.</h4><p>Be in the moment. Enjoy whatever the food you are eating. Get outside and have a walk, read a book or just take in the day for whatever amount of time you can spare.</p><h4>Do something different each evening.</h4><p>This helps in keeping you away from boredom. Routine way of life gets you bored easily. Don’t just come home, eat dinner and relax on the couch. We should mix things up, if anything go for a long drive out into the wilderness, have a hike planned, take your pet for a walk or visit a beach, watch some movies (the kind you have never seen before) or just have bonfires in the backyard. Just because it is “an evening in the weekdays” doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy it!</p><h4>Don’t go into an eating rut!</h4><p>Have something you really enjoy for each meal. Even if it it’s something cooked at home, have a change of menu everyday. And I tried cooking something on my own, didn’t turn out to be good, but it really gave me a lot of satisfaction. Plan out some fun dinner, which is both fun to make and eat! Once you start experimenting in the kitchen, it is hard to stop and the possibilities are endless!</p><h4>Reminiscing your day before bed.</h4><p>Be thankful for everything that happened during the day. The most important thing of all these things is to practice mindfulness throughout the day. Even on your way to work, which may seem like the most mundane thing ever, take in the weather, the sounds, the sights. At work, notice the people around you, and make the best of whatever your job might be. You’re there, so may as well make the best of it and take pride in your accomplishments. Our world is always changing, every second of every hour, so make sure you witness as much of it as you can.</p><p>Hope this helps at least someone in their life. If these tricks really helped you too, take time to throw in some claps.

A particularly interesting new data type, that can shed light on human populations and development challenges, comes from mobile network operators. Mobile Operators register Call Detail Records (CDRs) contain the time and associated cell tower of text messages, calls and other billable events. In de-identified format, these CDRs can be used to study human behaviour and mobility patterns at large scale, in near-real time and most importantly in places where other sources of data are not available.</p>\n<p>With the number of mobile phone subscriptions constantly increasing around the world, this provides unprecedented opportunities to improve our understanding of human populations and better answer to the needs of vulnerable populations. Worldwide, we reached the five billion mark of mobile phone subscription in 2017 – with the latest one billion subscribers being reached in only four years (GSMA, 2017). Nearly 70% of the economically bottom fifth of the population in low-and middle-income countries now own a mobile phone. Based on this enormous growth, CDR data can for example support development activities in areas such as public health, poverty alleviation and infrastructure planning, as well as preparedness and response to disasters.</p>\n<p>The collaboration with the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) will deliver <em>FlowKit</em>, an open source, state of the art and easy-to-use toolkit that will strengthen and facilitate large-scale analyses of mobile operator data for development and humanitarian purposes. Our team will be rolling out a series of releases starting in the Autumn 2018, alongside documentation and templates. The releases will contain our present internal code base, documented and structured to be suitable for the open source community, as well as a number of expansions to the toolkit. User groups amongst Mobile Network Operators in low and middle-income countries and leading humanitarian and development agencies will support the validation of requirements, roadmaps and functionality.</p>\n<p>Led by engineers, data scientists and subject area experts at Flowminder, the project will empower Mobile Network Operators and organisations to use insights from mobile operator data to improve their country’s development policy and disaster response. Our team has a track record of producing insights from CDR data to support development and humanitarian community with targeted analyses for decision support, as well as publishing peer-reviewed <a href=\"http://www.flowminder.org/work/research-innovation\">academic work</a> on the use of mobile operator data. We will leverage this experience to provide the community with an expandable open source system that can support diverse tools using mobile operator data.

I have spent a month in Lleida, Liquid Galaxy Labs.<br /><br />To be honest, this was my first internship and I feel very lucky that I could come here from Turkey and learn a lot of things, meet a lot of people. As a foreign student, having a practice outside my country has been an incredible experience both because I discovered significant concepts on computer science and practiced my three-week Spanish that I started learning last summer in Malaga. Here in the labs, there are also workshops and events and people with different ideas come and share their projects, opinions, tools and technologies they use. For instance Lot Amoros, the creator of Dronecoria Project for reforestation, shared his ideas and we, students also shared our opinions about what can be done. This has been a very valuable experience due to the project and meeting Lot Amoros himself. We also had a workshop concerning Google Assistant and AIY Voice Kit with the participation of teenagers. We prepared quizzes and flashcards with Actions on Google to use on Google Home and Google Home Mini.<br /><br /> In this four-week period, I experienced open source with Liquid Galaxy. My colleague Oscar Carrasco, also a visiting student from University La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain, was able to adapt the Liquid Galaxy to chromebooks for the project, Liquid Galaxy for Education. Now, a team of four including me is working on the Android tablet application that will be used for Liquid Galaxy for Education.<br /><br /><br /> As a foreign computer science student, my stay in Lleida has widened my world by all means, and I thank Andreu Ibáñez for this experience and his hospitality!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bpmp_uejnE/W1BhtWNizcI/AAAAAAAGdk0/UJh5MNONErw0zgk_Ck72sOIvVsR5wkTYwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180626_150228.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bpmp_uejnE/W1BhtWNizcI/AAAAAAAGdk0/UJh5MNONErw0zgk_Ck72sOIvVsR5wkTYwCLcBGAs/s640/IMG_20180626_150228.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>My experience visiting Lleida<br />Oscar Carrasco</b></span><br />My name is Óscar Carrasco and I am a junior student of Computer Engineering at Universidad de La Laguna (Tenerife, Spain). <br /><br />I met Andreu in last July, in his TLP Innova conference about Google Summer of Code which really interested me, so I decided to stay in touch with him. We contacted again in November and, one month later, I collaborated with him as a Liquid Galaxy project mentor in the Google Code-in program.<br /><br />This experience was enjoyable to me, so I travelled to Lleida this summer in order to keep developing Open-source software in a project called “Liquid Galaxy for Education”.<br /><br />The first two things that got my attention in Lleida were the blazing hot weather and the lack of sea. Since I’ve been living near the ocean my entire life, it was suffocating not to see it around me. It was hard for me to get used to the climate.<br /><br />The main activity was working in the labs in the morning. We managed to port most of the core Liquid Galaxy features into the Chromebooks during my stance, as it was intended to happen. My partners were also working on improving the legacy Liquid Galaxy Controller Android application during this time.<br /><br />We were also involved in many other tasks. We went to the cinema, had dinner at Punto Estrella, (popular restaurant in Lleida), participated in a local radio channel called UA1, visited a startup called InTech3D and hosted three Google Developer Group meetups in our spare time. And we did all of this in only five days! I had never felt so productive in my entire life.<div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c42WO5Vc0_Y/W1BgZ8O7JOI/AAAAAAAGdko/DcAZsk_Ioj0ZxC8rcrPApyunlEYk0RRLwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180718_153559_Bokeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1600\" data-original-width=\"1200\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c42WO5Vc0_Y/W1BgZ8O7JOI/AAAAAAAGdko/DcAZsk_Ioj0ZxC8rcrPApyunlEYk0RRLwCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20180718_153559_Bokeh.jpg\" width=\"240\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">Deniz left, Oscar right</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">At the end of the summer we'll continue this with histories from the other students, <br />Ivan, Aleks and Albert, from EPS, Lleida.</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Meb84ugPlSo/W1BiLvPV20I/AAAAAAAGdlE/sKufGS3oj-MlmwuMQxGXLh_ZqGmi1esmQCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180629_133416.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Meb84ugPlSo/W1BiLvPV20I/AAAAAAAGdlE/sKufGS3oj-MlmwuMQxGXLh_ZqGmi1esmQCLcBGAs/s640/IMG_20180629_133416.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div></div>","published":"2018-07-19T10:05:00.003Z","author":"Andreu Ibáñez","link":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4643387265233889970/posts/default/9195946979798973248","feed":{"source":"http://www.liquidgalaxylab.com/feeds/posts/default","name":"Liquid Galaxy LAB","link":"http://www.liquidgalaxylab.com/feeds/posts/default"}},{"title":"Calling students and contributors: list of available code and more developments for our 2018 projects","content":"During this summer 2018 and the upcoming first semester of 2018/2019 we're focused on two developments. <br /><b>This is a call for our students and mentors to collaborate on their development.</b><br /><br />The projects tasks coordination will be handled by Deniz Yüksel and Andreu Ibanez, address them for extended information.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E6ur49R0V2A/W0hjkt1ScfI/AAAAAAAGcW8/mA_IEnscCxcNplU4FpEha-kWWBbEqiiWgCLcBGAs/s1600/LiquidGalaxy%2Bfor%2BEducation%2Blogo%2B%25281%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"550\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"137\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E6ur49R0V2A/W0hjkt1ScfI/AAAAAAAGcW8/mA_IEnscCxcNplU4FpEha-kWWBbEqiiWgCLcBGAs/s400/LiquidGalaxy%2Bfor%2BEducation%2Blogo%2B%25281%2529.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div>Our team of students, residents and visitors,&nbsp;are working hard on the development of the LGxEDU applications.

I couldn’t find an easy way to deploy docker images to EC2 instances. So, I made a workaround of my own using a crazy simple tool we all know of, the <strong>SSH</strong>.</p><p>Through this tutorial, I’m gonna be assuming that you have a working EC2 instance with sudo access to the shell and you already have a docker-compose file ready to set off to production.</p><h4>Setting up EC2 instance</h4><p>SSH into your instance and install docker and docker-compose on it. There are numerous tutorials available online on how to install them. So, I’m not gonna cover that here.</p><p>Once you’ve got them setup, choose a location to place your docker-compose.yml file. Preferably somewhere in /opt/&lt;your_app_name&gt; . So, now, try deploying the compose file directly using docker-compose up -d . Once you’re sure that works, let’s move on to the next step.</p><p>Generate an SSH RSA private/public key pair, that we’re going to use to login from GitLab CI runner and run the deploy script. To generate the key pair, we’ll use ssh-keygen.</p><pre>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f privkey</pre><p>Now, you should have two files, privkey and privkey.pub in your current working directory. Paste the contents of privkey as is (without extra spaces) into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the EC2 instance. Copy the contents of privkey.pub , we’ll be using that later from the gitlab CI.</p><h4>Setting up GitLab CI/CD job</h4><p>I’m gonna show an opinionated GitLab CI configuration file, which we’ll be using to build and deploy the images from master branch of the repository.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p68SyHN3hNK0gkXs7554EA.png\" /><figcaption>GitLab CI Configuration.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, we use the GitLab CI preferences pane, where we’ll setup a few environment variables listed below.</p><ul><li>DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY: The contents of privkey.pub which we generated earlier.</li><li>DEPLOY_SERVER_IP : The IP address of the EC2 instance.</li><li>DEPLOY_HOST : The username of the EC2 instance, eg. ubuntu , if you use a ubuntu base image for setting up EC2 instance.</li></ul><p>Make sure that you’ve turned on the protected flag in the variables section for each of the variables to set them only on protected branches like master.</p><p>From the GitLab CI configuration file, you can see that there is a script .ci/deploy.sh on the repository which we’ll be using to run for deployments. It can be something like this.</p><pre># .ci/deploy.sh</pre><pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash<br />set -x -e -o pipefail</pre><pre>COMPOSE_LOCATION=\"/opt/&lt;your_app_name&gt;/master\"<br />DOCKER_GROUP_NAME=\"docker\"</pre><pre># Early checks<br />which docker<br />which docker-compose<br />id -nG | grep \"$DOCKER_GROUP_NAME\"</pre><pre># Start deployment<br />cd $COMPOSE_LOCATION<br />docker-compose pull<br />docker-compose up -d</pre><p>That’s it, you’re done setting up CD with GitLab.</p><img height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5e215154730f\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/my-new-roots/ship-it-5e215154730f\">Ship it!</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/my-new-roots\">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","published":"2018-07-11T02:24:10.000Z","author":"","link":"https://medium.com/my-new-roots/ship-it-5e215154730f?source=rss----3f7df00e1da2---4","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"Liquid Galaxy para Educación","content":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0vjTgqHZCTY/WrzFIIgm6TI/AAAAAAAGEpo/KZqj8ueejmIhkP9_-9V030kUo-_4WBjyACLcBGAs/s1600/_DSC6511.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"869\" data-original-width=\"1303\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0vjTgqHZCTY/WrzFIIgm6TI/AAAAAAAGEpo/KZqj8ueejmIhkP9_-9V030kUo-_4WBjyACLcBGAs/s400/_DSC6511.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />El Liquid Galaxy para Educación es un proyecto bajo desarrollo en 2018 por diferentes actores, como los estudiantes de la Escuela Politécnica Superior de la Universidad de Lleida que trabajan en el Liquid Galaxy LAB, la comunidad mundial a través de nuestro <a href=\"https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>, el partnership con <a href=\"http://www.xenoncomputer.com/xenoncomputer/portada.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Xenon Computer</a>&nbsp;y sus Chromebooks ACER, y diversos profesionales de la educación.<br /><br /><div><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j_5Qcyn_r80/Wpg92fPxiKI/AAAAAAAF_4g/gIqgbknFxP4PRkrPwLaSumzFcuVZhv7vQCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20180227_161423.jpg\" /></div><br />El objetivo del proyecto en desarrollo es crear un compendio de software y documentación que permitan a profesores y otros profesionales de la educación, replicar de una forma sencilla y didáctica la experiencia del Liquid Galaxy en entornos educativos de todo tipo.<br /><br />Para conseguir este objetivo hemos seleccionado trabajar con la plataforma hardware Chromebook de Google, disponible por muchos fabricantes e instalada ya en muchos centros educativos españoles y de todo el mundo. Los Chromebooks son generalmente portátiles de potencia media y fácil uso con su sistema operativo Chrome OS, bajo coste de adquisición, mantenimiento y gestión, y que están muy orientados al mercado educativo.<br /><br />El software estará compuesto primero por el core Liquid Galaxy instalado en los Chromeboosk bajo Crouton, un software que permite la instalación de Linux muy fácil y rápidamente, y que será ejecutado a la vez que el Chrome OS. Aparte está definiéndose y desarrollándose una aplicación Android para ser ejecutaba en una tableta de 7 a 10\", y que dispondrá de los controles del sistema, así como de una aplicación educativa abierta, que vendrá precargada de material educativo para Geografía e Historia y que permitirá a los profesores expandir los contenidos por ellos mismos.<br /><br /><div style=\"background-color: white;

It was the 12th February, 2018 and the list of accepted mentoring organizations was published. I booted up my laptop in excitement to give the list a glance. When I scrolled through, I was unable to find AboutCode (the organization I was contributing to) in the roll. I was devastated at the unfortunate event and spent the next few hours pondering over my endeavour since the past couple of months.</p> <p>I had always dreamt of becoming a DOUBLE GSOCER and I knew it wasn’t going to be easy. This would mean I would have to reiterate the entire process, i.e. shortlist an organization and start contributing from scratch ! After a heavy setback, I decided to continue with the struggle and not give up on my aspiration. I found <a href=\"https://spdx.org/\">SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange)</a> which is an open standard for communicating software bill of material information (including components, copyrights, and security references). I spent the next few weeks exploring the Python library to parse, validate and create SPDX documents and preparing mockups. Since the project involved lexing and parsing, I had to comprehend the fundamentals of compiler theory. Fast forward to the judgement day; I was busy refreshing the GSoC page, in the middle of the road, with my friend to check the result and here’s what it displayed:</p> <figure> <img src=\"https://yash-nisar.github.io/images/gsoc18_acceptance.png\" /> </figure> <p>Furthermore, I received a mail from Google confirming my selection for the paramount program.</p> <figure> <img src=\"https://yash-nisar.github.io/images/gsoc18_acceptance_mail.png\" /> </figure> <h2 id=\"whats-next-\">What’s next ?</h2> <p>The community bonding period is almost over with just a week remaining. I have almost completed upgrading the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Document</code> class and initiated a few bug fixes. I would like to heartily thank my mentors <a href=\"https://github.com/pombredanne\">@pombredanne</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/krysnuvadga\">@krysnuvadga</a> for keeping faith in me throughout the process and giving me the opportunity to be a part of the SPDX community.

Why the title?</h2> <p>Because I am in that phase of life where I need to take one of the most important decisions of my life and it turns out that my thoughts are a chaos. Let’s compare the things I know v/s the things I don’t:</p> <ul> <li>I know what I can do: <ul> <li>Contribute to open source more often.</li> <li>Write more regularly.</li> <li>Start looking for ideas for my research.</li> <li>Finish all the MOOC’s I’ve lined up.</li> <li>Start implementing the pet project I’ve been thinking for months.</li> <li>Read more books.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I don’t know what I would do: <ul> <li>Do I go for a job after B.tech? <ul> <li>If yes, then do I need to do something differently from what I am currently doing?</li> </ul> </li> <li>or, I should rather go for higher studies - MS, Robotics? <ul> <li>If yes, then does the preparation requires that I need to abandon some of the things I’ve listed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Is the preparation for the above two mutually exclusive?</li> </ul> </li> <li>and moreover, I don’t know what is stopping me? <ul> <li>Is it lethargy? <ul> <li>Do I not want to do these things? Nope, it’s the exact opposite, I don’t want to do anything other than these things. I can dedicate any (or all) amount of my free time doing these things.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Am I too busy? <ul> <li>Nope, the workload from College is pretty less. Apart from hanging out with a few friends, I don’t really do much.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do I not put in enough efforts? <ul> <li>No, I try every bit I can to achieve these things, I wake up as early as 5:30, don’t have a girlfriend, no TV, no movies.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do I not have enough resources? <ul> <li>No, I have more than enough resources at hand - I have a fast Internet connection, a powerful computer and access to powerful servers for anything power savvy. I have god friends to support me and wise teachers/mentors to advice me.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Am I just slow? <ul> <li>Yes, probably.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id=\"is-it-the-first-time-you-are-confused\">Is it the first time you are confused?</h2> <p>Every career related decision I had to take up until now, I never really had to sit and think. They just came naturally, take the example of:</p> <ul> <li>What stream after High School? <ul> <li>Biology - Nope, can’t look at blood.</li> <li>Arts - My sense of art is “horrible”, not very good with social sciences either.</li> <li>Commerce - Although I like it, I wasn’t very fond of finding mistakes in other people’s calculation.</li> <li>Mathematics - Hell yeah, let’s go study it.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What college do you want to go to?</p> <p>I was already a student in the Aligarh Muslim University when I applied for B.Tech program - My rank elsewhere was average, so it was the only option. I like the city, my friends are here - I feel like I did no mistake.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id=\"did-you-always-wanted-to-pursue-higher-studies\">Did you always wanted to pursue higher studies?</h2> <p>Nope, I never even thought of pursuing higher education. With the advent of MOOC’s and the Internet, I thought that I would never need formal training. But, soon enough, I was introduced to the field of autonomous robotics and MOOC’s weren’t able to satisfy my hunger, perhaps because it requires practical/physical exposure. At this time, I just had a faint, out of nowhere idea of an MS, but I wasn’t very serious. When no one around me was getting a job I thought we can get, I started to take this idea into consideration.</p> <p>When the results for the third semester were out, a month ago, before entering my name into the website, I thought to myself about planning my reaction and almost naturally, yet passionlessly, my brain spurred out that I am ready to accept whatever I had expected (~ 8 ± 0.2). There need not any “resolutions” wherein I would try working harder the next time or to attend more classes, because what I believe today “Mr. Busy effect” - I won’t be able to give time to other things I (like to) do (contribute to open source, mentor new folks in AMU-OSS, study robotics, write blog posts, read). I also thought that I ain’t learning in class anyways, so my current way of studying (don’t ever open your book in regular days and cram everything the night before the test) was the “optimum” choice.</p> <p>Ready for results, with absolutely no enthusiasm, I entered my credentials into the website and kept staring at it. I was trying to calculate how precarious life can turn out to be - I had scored a whooping 9.4 / 10 (my highest ever in college) and I was actually feeling happy (maybe it was shock, I’m not sure). The next few moments, I critically examined my result only to find out that I have got a few A’s in the subjects I thought I never would and quite ironically I also scored a B in a subject I thought I never would! ;-) I had “my moment” then and there, but soon everything faded away in the color of life.</p> <p>Not until, I had started preparing myself for this (4th) semester’s mid-term tests, I realized that somewhere inside me, I had started to feel that I want to score high again, I want to study for exams - What if I scored low again? - What about MS?</p> <p>This is where I started feeling confused. Can I afford an MS, would I be selected, am I too late?</p> <h3 id=\"solutions-i-thought-of-when-researching-for-this-post\">Solutions (I thought of when researching for this post)</h3> <p>Although I don’t have answers to all (or any) of my questions, it turns out that writing this blog post gave me some clarity on the situation:</p> <ul> <li>I should read more on the topic, especially Quora.</li> <li>I am not late, it is the ideal time to start preparation.</li> <li>that I need to go out there and get things done, no more infinitely long “thought drills”</li> <li>Also, that if you decide to take one step ahead and you would definitely find a way to a solution.</li> </ul> <p>Thank You for reading! - I’d highly appreciate your advice!</p>","published":"2018-03-30T19:03:03.000Z","author":"","link":"http://rj722.tech/statement-of-chaos/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"The Liquid Galaxy experience at Google Code-in 2017 published on Google Open Source main blog and networks","content":"<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD-fQ1Bs7ck/Wrkm5BQD1kI/AAAAAAAGEU4/xpVGHwxy8rgcFqwOfL_UjWJoifIzTeNSgCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"240\" data-original-width=\"320\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD-fQ1Bs7ck/Wrkm5BQD1kI/AAAAAAAGEU4/xpVGHwxy8rgcFqwOfL_UjWJoifIzTeNSgCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png\" /></a></div><br /><br /><div style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;\">Blog post:&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/03/a-galactic-experience-in-google-code-in.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522169907395000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHsomn7BHDj_T8_2nZjPL3RI5dSgA\" href=\"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/03/a-galactic-experience-in-google-code-in.html\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\" target=\"_blank\">https://opensource.<wbr></wbr>googleblog.com/2018/03/a-<wbr></wbr>galactic-experience-in-google-<wbr></wbr>code-in.html</a></div><div style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;\">Twitter:&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://twitter.com/GoogleOSS/status/978305986954854400&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522169907395000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEG2vX1SXImLTp26_BYfzJnNG9z7Q\" href=\"https://twitter.com/GoogleOSS/status/978305986954854400\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/<wbr></wbr>GoogleOSS/status/<wbr></wbr>978305986954854400</a></div><div style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;\">Facebook:&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.facebook.com/GoogleOpenSource/posts/323518418052988&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522169907395000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGu7Pn76eE-e4Jrw4Zmht6efghWgQ\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GoogleOpenSource/posts/323518418052988\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.<wbr></wbr>facebook.com/GoogleOpenSource/<wbr></wbr>posts/323518418052988</a></div><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;\">Google+:&nbsp;</span><a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://plus.google.com/%2BGoogleOpenSource/posts/TizZ2FkQCuC&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522169907395000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2qR_namBorsSg1yvO8QVrsBEzlA\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/+GoogleOpenSource/posts/TizZ2FkQCuC\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #1155cc; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;\" target=\"_blank\">https://plus.google.com/+<wbr></wbr>GoogleOpenSource/posts/<wbr></wbr>TizZ2FkQCuC</a>","published":"2018-03-26T17:00:00.001Z","author":"Andreu Ibáñez","link":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4643387265233889970/posts/default/69616070866614837","feed":{"source":"http://www.liquidgalaxylab.com/feeds/posts/default","name":"Liquid Galaxy LAB","link":"http://www.liquidgalaxylab.com/feeds/posts/default"}},{"title":"Rahul Jha: Organising the Mozilla visit","content":"<p>During PyCon India, I had the privilege to meet Sanyam (<a href=\"https://github.com/CuriousLeaner\">@CuriousLeaner</a>), whom I already knew as a mentor to many in the #dgplug community, when he visited the coala community space. We had a short discussion about How to nurture Open Source Communities in college? It was then, when @crancg got him to join the slack for AMU-OSS. And then, one wild day we invited Sanyam to come speak at our college and share his insights on OSS and the following event was born.</p> <p><img alt=\"Group_Photo\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15556382/36986480-eacc15be-20bf-11e8-98d0-9ed9c9331f4b.jpg\" /></p> <h2 id=\"what-happened-there\">What happened there?</h2> <h3 id=\"free-and-open-source-software\">Free and Open Source Software</h3> <p>The first part of the session consisted of an introduction to the concept of Free and Open Source Software, and was chaired by Sanyam - the students were made aware of the importance of FOSS in the world. He and the other mentors also took questions and cleared the doubts of students regarding the world of open source.</p> <h3 id=\"how-to-build-an-add-on-for-mozilla\">How to build an Add-on for Mozilla?</h3> <p>The second part of the session was a hands-on technical event, and the students were taught how to implement an add-on (extension) for Mozilla Firefox. The importance of extensions for adding functionality to any browser was stressed, and the students were encouraged to build their own add-ons and to get them published.</p> <h3 id=\"what-next\">What next?</h3> <p>The final part of the event involved the mentors explaining how students could contribute to open source, and how the community was always looking to better itself through the contributions of new and young talent. The talk was inspirational and the students in attendance seemed motivated and encouraged to become a part of the development community.</p> <h2 id=\"vote-of-thanks\">Vote of Thanks</h2> <p>First of all, I would like to thank Sanyam, Shashank and Shivam for coming to the event and inspiring students. A huge shoutout to @crancg for having established AMU-OSS.

I picked a task from <a href=\"https://coala.io\">coala</a> because, well, I thought “coala” was a cute name. coala is a handy tool that can lint and often fix problems in your source code. They have a very helpful guide for newcomers too, making it easy for anyone to get started with contributing.</p><p>My first task was a coding task, but the process of using git and creating tests proved far tougher than writing the main piece of code. I made a lot of mistakes in these areas, and didn’t do things quite the way I should have been doing them, but with some help from my mentors my work was eventually merged, and I had made my first contribution. Success!</p><p>Almost a month later, and I’ve completed an array of different tasks and learnt a ton of new stuff. School, exams and other priorities meant I couldn’t dedicate as much time as I would have liked to Code-In, but I made sure to attempt a variety of different tasks in different areas. Naturally, I encountered difficulties on almost every task — there was a lot of time spent meticulously reading through source code in an attempt to understand things, and I lost count of the number of times I had to ask for extensions. These difficulties are of course key to improving and amongst other things, I’ve finally got the hang of git, I’ve dabbled with graphics and regex for the first time, and (after several run-ins with coala’s linting bears) I’ve learnt to write cleaner and better code.</p><p>But I think the most important things I have learnt come from the experience of working within a real-life organisation. The process I had to go through in order to understand and build upon existing code taught me a lot, and using various tools to complete my tasks has given me valuable practical skills and knowledge that will no doubt be helpful in the future.</p><p>I’m incredibly grateful to the mentors at coala for providing very detailed and justified feedback where necessary, answering questions and helping me to resolve any problems. Working with such knowledgeable and friendly people has been extremely rewarding, and I hope to continue contributing to the organisation.</p><p>Finally, I’d like to thank Google for making this wonderful experience possible. I’m a little sad that I didn’t find out about GCI sooner as I’ll be too old to participate again next year, but nonetheless, I have had a lot of fun and look forward to diving deeper into the world of OSS!</p><img height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ba254d19ce28\" width=\"1\" />","published":"2018-01-16T21:15:27.000Z","author":"","link":"https://medium.com/@biscuitsnake/code-in-with-coala-ba254d19ce28?source=rss-12bb3099dbe9------2","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"Naveen Kumar Sangi: Boilerplates are fun, right?!","content":"<p>Good bye crappy config files!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/945/1*up5_dOjlNdHMTa3Cw-Ku2w.png\" /></figure><p>I’m trying out <a href=\"https://parceljs.org\"><strong>Parcel.js</strong></a> for one of my most recent endeavours and I must say I’m quite loving it so far.

However in different migrations, it just adds another index.</p> <p><b>Solution</b>:</p> <p>I’m not sure if this is a feature or a bug. To solve for the cases where migrations run together(dev machines) or on servers where they are run separately I used <code>remove_index</code> if <code>index_exists?</code> .</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p> <p>This isn’t something “breaking or a huge discovery”, just something weird i found in my Rails Journey and something you should be aware about.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p><br /> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com/383/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com/383/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com&amp;blog=108096159&amp;post=383&amp;subd=learningstuffeveryday&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" />","published":"2018-01-12T11:29:15.000Z","author":"","link":"https://learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com/2018/01/12/rails-migrations-are-contextual/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}},{"title":"Rahul Jha: How to get started with self driving cars","content":"<h1 id=\"how-to-get-started-with-self-driving-cars\">How to get started with self driving cars?</h1> <p>I’ve asked myself (and Google) this question numerous times and have always learned something new in the process which in turn has lead to a superficial learning of autonomous technology — helping me getting a taste of it, but for a deeper knowledge on the subject, I must complete courseware, develop some projects for hands on experience and in the process network with people who have seasoned this art who can help me get a better insight on the current trends in research and industry.</p> <p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gYTE7HBbZokfRhXMDB7VUg.gif\" /></p> <h2 id=\"courseware\">COURSEWARE</h2> <p>I’ve completed my home work of figuring out a Coursework for conquering the world of Self Driving Cars:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://rj722.tech/deeplearning.ai\">Deep Learning specialisation</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://in.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373\">Artificial Intelligence for Robotics</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271\">Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344\">Intro to parallel Programming</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://rj722.tech/cs231n.stanford.edu\">CS231N</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/mobile-robot\">mobile-robot</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/underactuated-robotics-mitx-6-832x-0\">Underactuated robotics</a></li> <li>https://www.udacity.com/apollo (Yet to start)</li> </ul> <p>I haven’t included the Udacity self driving car Nanodegree program (although, it is a great resource) because it is quite expensive.

For example, if your todo list currently says - go on morning walk, a yet more effective way of saying this would be - Within 30 minutes of waking up, walk 1.5 kms. Therefore, I’ll try to be as clear as possible when posing a project statement.</p> <p>So, here’s the list of the projects I want to complete in the process:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Develop a brain for a self driving car</strong> <ul> <li>A neural network is to be implemented from scratch (no copy-pasting - typed in by hand) to spit out steering angle, gas and breaks given a frame of a road scene.</li> <li>It is encouraged to take help from related research papers.</li> <li>Any framework - TensorFlow, Torch, Caffe, etc may be used to implement this neural network.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Autonomous Driving Agent for GTA-5</strong> <ul> <li>GTA-5 in itself provides a rich environment for simulation and developing a self driving vehicle for the game would be quite educating and challenging.</li> <li>Implement a neural network which can completely navigate itself around on a particular road in GTA-5.</li> <li>You may retrain your prior project for the same!</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>A completely self driving RC car</strong> <ul> <li>It should be able to drive itself on any track (a circular one, no navigation decisions required), after 10 laps of training.</li> <li>The car should drive itself completely autonomously for at least 10 mins, and preferably until battery dies.</li> <li>Use whatever tech stack - donkey, Apollo, etc and hardware you wish to use.</li> <li>Complete this project with a physical car, not in simulation.</li> <li>It’s okay to collaborate with others on the project.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Plus, there would be lots of fun projects I’d be implementing from the curriculum of the various courses.</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"some-extra-fun-to-dos\">Some extra fun TO-DO’s:</h2> <ul> <li>Participate in the diyrobocar races, you can even participate in the upcoming transit olympics</li> <li>Join slack channels for donkey and Self Driving Car Nanodegree program from Udacity</li> <li>Try and make your friends interested in the same - we learn better in a group and grow better as a community.</li> <li>Go to meetups, network with like minded people and learn with them.</li> </ul> <p>I am pretty excited to dive in — let’s see how this would turn out to be!

(Image parts by freepik.com)</figcaption></figure> <p>(This post was crossposted with minor modifications <a href=\"https://medium.com/@gitmate_io/github-issue-notifications-on-open-source-projects-8104eb5c6e9b\">on medium</a>.)</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"ef0e\">Many Open Source Project maintainers suffer from a significant overdose of GitHub notifications. Many have turned them off completely for that.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5f6\"><a href=\"https://gitmate.io/\">We (GitMate.io)</a> are constantly researching about how people handle a flood of incoming issues in our aim to improve the situation by <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://gitmate.io/features\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">applying modern technologies</a> to the problem. (Oh and we love free software!)</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0e78\">By analyzing the biggest open source repositories on GitHub (more info on the data below) we’ve seen that the contributors to any of those projects responds to only 2.3% of all issues on average. (Let a contributor be a person that commented on at least two issues which they didn’t open.)</p> <figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"f4c5\"> <div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"> <div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div> <div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\"><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\" height=\"50\" width=\"75\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R4S6yIEqW1vNJ-S3Xx4R6Q.png\" /></div> </div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Contributor Interest Histogram (Summed over the biggest repositories)</figcaption></figure> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"69d5\">This makes clear that for any bigger open source project, “Watching” the repository is resulting in a lot of spam for most of the people. If they don’t respond, notifying them was of no value for the discussion after all.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d8d2\">We can also observe that only very few project managers care for any significant portion of the issues. Only 6 of our human contributors in total care for more than every 5th issue at all. Here’s our heros:</p> <pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"dffd\">25.05%: golang/go -&gt; ianlancetaylor, Watching 47.48%: moby/moby -&gt; thaJeztah, Watching 27.31%: moby/moby -&gt; cpuguy83, Watching 36.67%: owncloud/core -&gt; PVince81, Not watching 47.12%: saltstack/salt -&gt; gtmanfred, Watching 25.54%: saltstack/salt -&gt; Ch3LL, Watching</pre> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"d310\">However, we do see that 29.1% (117) of all contributors (402) are still subscribed to all notifications of the repository (watching it).</p> <h4 class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\" id=\"8105\">Switching to Polling</h4> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"aef0\">Many contributors switch to polling instead of watching the main repository.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2a2e\">However, we still see that the main maintainers keep watching the repository: without them, it’s very easy to miss out on new issues and it’s hard to make sure that the right people take a look at the right issues in a decentralized system.</p> <h4 class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\" id=\"f8d0\">Introducing Automation</h4> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"3a99\">In many communities we see home grown bots arising that apply labels and sometimes assign people based on keywords. This works especially well for automatically created issues (e.g. from <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://sentry.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sentry</a>) but is not a full solution.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e029\">We’ve tried it. Contributors started mentioning keywords consciously and it didn’t really work for user reported issues.</p> <h4 class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\" id=\"cb2a\">Better Automation!</h4> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"a947\">We wouldn’t be GitMate if we didn’t strive for more. Our data suggests that people are spending way too much time on their notifications. We’ve maintained <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://coala.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">coala.io</a> in the past and we know that reading through all of them is impossible even for core maintainers. Static keyword based automation doesn’t seem to be enough.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"35b4\">Since quite a while we’re hacking on an artificial intelligence that helps you dealing with this problem by analyzing exactly what every person in your team is discussing about on GitHub or GitLab and mentioning the ones who are important for solving any new issue.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bf53\">GitMate is built as a full automated triaging solution. Right now it already mentions related developers in new issues, finds duplicates, labels issues and closes old issues. It is already used by companies like <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://owncloud.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ownCloud</a> and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.kiwi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kiwi.com</a>and we’re looking for more beta testers.</p> <p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bf29\">If you like this idea, visit <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://gitmate.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitMate.io</a> and shoot us an email to <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"mailto:lasse@gitmate.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lasse@gitmate.io</a> :).

We only wanted to look at the biggest ones (measured by scraped file size, i.e. roughly amount of text over all issues communicated). We’ve excluded ‘ZeroK-RTS/CrashReports’ because no humans seem to be operating that repository.

Although I was already a member of several small organizations, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/gitpoint\">GitPoint</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Chaosthebot\">ChaosTheBot</a> and my local FIRST Robotics Team, this is my first experience working with a really large organizations — in my case, <a href=\"https://github.com/coala\">coala</a>. It’s an amazing experience, so I’m incredibly grateful to <a href=\"https://g.co/gci\">Google Code-In</a> for the opportunity.</p><p>Working with everyone at coala has been fantastic. Not only have I been introduced to a wonderful and powerful code linter (which I’ve already started to implement into my existing code bases), I’ve also learned a ton about Python, unit tests, coala’s commit guidelines and probably most importantly, how to work in a large-scale team environment.</p><p>In the Google Code-In competition, students claim bite-sized “tasks” that usually involve solving a specific bug or adding a feature to one of their organization’s projects. Before “claiming” a task (committing to work on that specific issue) it’s generally good to research how you might go about it and what kinds of external tools or resources might be able to help you. For example, before I claimed a task involving the generation of an RSS feed for one of coala’s websites, I first found an NPM module that could easily create the feed and then read the documentation thoroughly to make sure I understood the module’s usage. At that point, I felt comfortable enough with the technology to claim the task.</p><p>If you are pushing yourself, eventually, you will run into a problem while solving a task. That’s totally fine. The mentors are there to help you overcome any barriers you may come across. I’ve ran into difficulties and had questions about a task several times, but contacting the coala mentors on Zulip or Gitter was very simple, and, after they get back to me quickly, we always work out a good solution. I’m very fortunate to have a huge team of mentors at coala who are willing to provide loads of feedback for even the smallest change, too. Learning directly from professionals in the programming industry has helped me become a better developer and improve my coding habits and abilities.</p><p>If you’re interested in coala, get involved by solving some newcomer issues. Once you’re comfortable, choose tasks in the coala repositories with a higher difficulty. The difficulty system set up in coala repositories is very helpful when you’re just starting off, as all issues are given a rating from newcomer, to low, to medium, to high, and you can pick and choose the issues with a rating you’re comfortable with.</p><p>Overall, coala has given me a stronger appreciation for all open source software, developers and maintainers while also helping me improve my own programming abilities. I’m very happy to be a member of the team and look forward to continuing to work with them well after this year’s Google Code-In competition is complete. Who knows, maybe in a few years I’ll be able to mentor the next generation of coala developers in their Google Code-In journey, and hopefully help them have just as good of a time as I’ve been having.</p><img height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=174c83855630\" width=\"1\" />","published":"2017-12-27T10:22:03.000Z","author":"","link":"https://medium.com/@andrewda/mid-google-code-in-thoughts-174c83855630?source=rss-6213d9ba759b------2","feed":{"source":"https://blog.coala.io/atom.xml","link":"https://blog.coala.io","name":"Planet coala"}}]
