<h2>Questions</h2>



<h3>Describe some of the important technical issues you foresee affecting the Fedora community. What insight do you bring to these issues?</h3>



<p>There is no question that modularity is the biggest technical issue affecting the Fedora community at the moment, and probably over the next year. I believe my insight comes from a few places. I was involved with rPath quite some time ago, where we tackled some of the issues that modularity is trying to solve. And as a kernel maintainer by day to day job, I don&#8217;t have any particular stake in modularity, so I can view it objectively, with an eye to what is best for Fedora over the long term. I have been involved with Fedora for a very long time, I do have a vested interest in the continued improvement of Fedora and the success and growth of the community.</p>



<h3>What objectives or goals should FESCo focus on to help keep Fedora on the cutting edge of open source development?</h3>



<p>Right now, I think working out the issues with modularity should be our top priority, as the current state has become a problem. Outside of that, there is really a long list of details, but it can be all be summarized with &#8220;ensure our processes for introducing new technologies are managed in such a way as to not alienate existing contributors, users, and use cases, while publishing stable releases with useful new features&#8221;</p>



<p> This includes things like:</p>



<ul><li>Improving our QA processes</li><li>Taking the time improve our release process</li><li>Ensuring new changes are ready before wedging them into a release</li><li>Making sure changes are not too disruptive to existing workflows.</li></ul>



<h3>What are the areas of the distribution and our processes that, in your opinion, need improvement the most? Do you have any ideas how FESCo would be able to help in those &#8220;trouble spots&#8221;?</h3>



<p>Modularity continues to be a trouble spot. It is a great feature in theory, adding capabilities to the distro as shipped, but even more so to people who are using or deploying the distro in their own environments. In practice, it has not been managed as well as it could be. There was always some backlash from the community members who just don&#8217;t care about modularity, or understand what it brings, but now there is also justified backlash in how things are being currently deployed. FESCo can help to ensure that further features around modularity are properly planned and executed, though there are a few fires to be put out first.</p>



<p>I also believe we can work to bake more security process automation into our workflow, to ensure that good practices are used for package builds, and CVEs are addressed in a timely manner. </p>

<h2>Questions</h2>



<h3>Describe some of the important technical issues you foresee affecting the Fedora community. What insight do you bring to these issues?</h3>



<p>We have a lot of people being unhappy how Modularity was &#8220;forced&#8221; on them in Fedora. I&#8217;d like to be a voice of this community and advocate of going back to simple yum repos to ship the default package set, and leaving Modularity strictly as an add-on one can choose, but doesn&#8217;t have to use.</p>



<h3>What objectives or goals should FESCo focus on to help keep Fedora on the cutting edge of open source development?</h3>



<p>Simplify Fedora packaging. Remove Modularity that makes everything more complicated. Help more people get involved in Fedora development by simplifying processes.</p>



<h3>What are the areas of the distribution and our processes that, in your opinion, need improvement the most? Do you have any ideas how FESCo would be able to help in those &#8220;trouble spots&#8221;?</h3>



<p>In my opinion, Modularity is a &#8220;trouble spot&#8221;. It needs to go.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>



<h3>Describe some of the important technical issues you foresee affecting the Fedora community. What insight do you bring to these issues?</h3>



<p>I think that modularity and the issues around it are going to continue for a while. I hope I can provide some help in bringing the &#8216;lets drop modularity and forget it happened&#8217; and the &#8216;lets modularize everything&#8217; camps together on some solution that works not only for Fedora, but our downstream distros too.</p>



<h3>What objectives or goals should FESCo focus on to help keep Fedora on the cutting edge of open source development?</h3>



<p>I think we really should look at a rework of our packaging workflow. Many of the things we setup in the past don&#8217;t make as much sense as they did then. Something like using signed tags to let the automation know what you want (build for X Y Z, or please run the CI on a build of this, or whatever). It&#8217;s not going to be easy, but I think if we design things right it will be a lot less work on our packagers. </p>



<h3>What are the areas of the distribution and our processes that, in your opinion, need improvement the most? Do you have any ideas how FESCo would be able to help in those &#8220;trouble spots&#8221;?</h3>



<p>Well, the workflow as noted. I think we just need to come up with a good framework and let the community help fill in the blanks. We did gather some good info on the devel list recently. </p>

<h2>Questions</h2>



<h3>Describe some of the important technical issues you foresee affecting the Fedora community. What insight do you bring to these issues?</h3>



<p>There have been many regressions with ease of use for tooling that 
packagers need to use to deliver software to Fedora&#8217;s users over the 
past few years. Quite a few things are manual now that used to be 
automatic. As a member of the infrastructure group, I have some first 
hand knowledge of how and why these changes happened, and I have ideas 
on how we can improve them.</p>



<p>There is also a project aimed at bringing the CentOS and Fedora 
dist-gits together in the horizon. I&#8217;ve been working on gathering 
requirements for this project with some other folks, and has potential 
to lead towards many technical changes being proposed.</p>



<h3>What objectives or goals should FESCo focus on to help keep Fedora on the cutting edge of open source development?</h3>



<p>I think Fedora is more difficult to contribute to than it needs to be. Some of this is due to the usability regressions I mentioned above, but I also think the barrier of entry is fairly high to join the package maintainers. There are some other distributions that allow contributors to simply open pull requests on GitHub, as an example of how low the barrier to entry could be. We, in comparison, require contributors to sign a CLA, submit a package review, perform several practice package reviews, and find a sponsor to join. I suspect that this limits our contributor pool significantly. I think it would be wise to rethink how we operate here, and find ways to lower the barrier of entry for new contributors. One example is to make it easier for contributors to send patches to the project without requiring them to be packagers.</p>



<h3>What are the areas of the distribution and our processes that, in your opinion, need improvement the most? Do you have any ideas how FESCo would be able to help in those &#8220;trouble spots&#8221;?</h3>



<p>As we&#8217;ve seen on the devel list recently, there is friction within the community around the modularity project. Some of the issues are technical, some of them are related to policy, and likely most of them are due to misunderstandings of communication and of the project itself. I think FESCo can help here by working to clarify these misunderstandings so that everybody can see the problem statements and proposed solutions more clearly.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>



<h3>Describe some of the important technical issues you foresee affecting the Fedora community. What insight do you bring to these issues?</h3>



<p>I think that the most important issue the Fedora community is facing 
at the moment, and will keep facing for the foreseeable future, is not 
really technical but instead a communication problem of how to talk 
about our technical changes and challenges. At FESCo level I will 
continue to work on:</p>



<ul><li>enforcing policies that aren&#8217;t being followed, which leads to 
stagnation, fo example problems where nobody communicated failures and 
breakage in a timely manner;</li><li>adjusting our policies to reflect community feedback, focusing on better notifications about relevant issues;</li><li>encouraging Fedora contributors (e.g. change owners) to communicate 
their intent and impact properly and making sure that the plans are 
adjusted based on the feedback they get from the community;</li><li>making it easier to contribute when blocked by nonresponsive maintainers;</li><li>assuring that impactful changes are communicated through the Fedora 
Change Process (and, if needed, changing the process itself to make it 
easier);</li><li>redirecting technical discussions from FESCo tickets to the 
appropriate mailing lists (most of the time the devel list), where 
there&#8217;s a greater chance of engaging community members in the 
discussion.</li></ul>



<p>One of the biggest things that is currently happening in Fedora is 
Modularity. It has high-impact technical challenges. In my opinion, 
FESCo must assure that the technical issues our community is 
experiencing are addressed, even if it means we decide not to deliver 
certain Modularity features until that happens. I&#8217;m quite concerned that
 alienating a big part the contributor community would be much harder to
 remedy than not delivering some features in the next Fedora release.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll end this answer in the same way I did in the <a href="https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fesco-election-interview-with-miro-hroncok-churchyard/">previous interview</a>,
 because I still stand by that opinion: The things in Fedora Engineering
 are moving forward at great speed towards progress. However, I think we
 should regularly take a moment to slow down and look back. How are the 
changes we made affect the life of an average Fedora packager? Tester? 
Translator? How does this affect our packaging standards? Is there 
buy-in from the community, or is it just for the ones involved?</p>



<h3>What objectives or goals should FESCo focus on to help keep Fedora on the cutting edge of open source development?</h3>



<p>I see two main concerns in this question:</p>



<p>First: to keep Fedora on the cutting edge of open source development.  For Fedora contributors, we must make sure that they can contribute to Fedora as easily as possible. As an example, I believe we&#8217;ve managed to make it easier to unblock contributors when it comes to nonresponsive  maintainers or packages that fail to build from sources. As FESCo, we  can hardly go and fix all the ignored packages and build failures, but  instead we have made the processes easier for individual contributors by  adjusting the existing policies. We should continue in this and strive  to make Fedora a more collaborative environment. One thing that I would  like to see changed, is that packages or modules (components generally)  are still pretty much owned by individuals. Most of them are awesome and  open to collaboration, yet some of them are unfortunately acting like  road blocks, rather than experts open to suggestions. We should make  sure that nothing in Fedora is private property, but rather implement a  collaborative workflow and environment.</p>



<p>Throughout my past year at FESCo, I&#8217;ve helped to change some of our 
policies to improve the situation and I&#8217;d like to continue to do so.</p>



<p>Secondly, to keep Fedora on the cutting edge of open source 
development for people using Fedora as their platform of choice, we must
 try to hear from them and model their use cases. When considering a 
change (or the status quo) in Fedora, we should ask how it impacts a 
Rust developer, a web designer, a Lua hacker, a Linux kernel engineer, a
 JavaScript student, a Python data analyst, a hardware specialist, a QA 
engineer, or any other kind of developer. For example, what happens if 
we deliberately delay a Fedora release for half a year? Will those 
people get the cutting edge tools they need? Will we provide the tools 
for them via regular updates or in some other way? How do we achieve it 
without telling everyone to use COPR or rawhide, without exhausting our 
contributors? And so on. We should figure such things out before making a
 tough decision.</p>



<p>During my past year at FESCo, I&#8217;ve asked myself such questions when 
approving or rejecting change proposals or other kinds of tickets. In 
several cases, I have even asked the change owners similar questions.</p>



<h3>What are the areas of the distribution and our processes that, in your opinion, need improvement the most? Do you have any ideas how FESCo would be able to help in those &#8220;trouble spots&#8221;?</h3>



<p>As for the distribution, I think it&#8217;s the modularity/non-modularity gap between people. For our processes, the nonresponsive-maintainers and fail-to-build-from-source / fail-to-install policies have been recently adapted, as they needed improvement the most. But the job is never done, we need to keep looking at these polices and adapt them to make Fedora not only a healthier tech stack, but also a healthier community. FESCo should assess new Fedora changes not only on the basis of how they are making Fedora superior, but also on how do they affect current Fedora contributors and whether the tooling for them is ready (or at least planned as part of a Fedora change).</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>



<h3>Describe some of the important technical issues you foresee affecting the Fedora community. What insight do you bring to these issues?</h3>



<ul><li>Developer controls for gating and CI. A lot of work has been happening in the context of continuous integration. We created new services, developed processes, and wrote tests. These are all beneficial. I think Fedora needs to ensure we implement developer tools that do not disrupt workflows and which are stable. In my project rpminspect, a Koji RPM and module build analysis tool, I think about developers who are running it to compare builds. A comparison of builds of zlib is very different than comparing two kernel builds, yet I still have a desire to make the tool work for both use cases, so I have added functionality to ensure it will. As we work on projects for gating and CI, we need to keep in mind the broad range and types of software that makeup Fedora.</li><li>Modularity and the many ways we make software available to users. Modularity is a topic that continues to get a lot of attention on the mailing lists. I want to see modularity discussions focus on goals and technical requirements. We can look at modularity as something contributed by Red Hat, a Fedora Project community member. Red Hat had a set of use cases and a deadline. Now we have it in Fedora because Fedora serves as the upstream for RHEL. We should remember that Red Hat relies on Fedora for technical leadership upstream. We should view modularity as a new starting point for a technical discussion on how we deliver software to users. Remember that RHEL-5 shipped with Xen virtualization, and the migration to KVM was worked out in Fedora, so RHEL-6 shipped with KVM.</li><li>Improve integration between our tools and services. I will use the Packit project as an example. Packit is an exciting project because it offers a bridge between upstream development and building for Fedora. And they are interested in improving that developer workflow and making it easier for software to be available in Fedora. Just like Packit, I see tools and infrastructure that we could focus on to improve the experience for package maintainers and other contributors. I would like to see the fedpkg command work for packages that pull their source archives from an upstream git repo. As a package maintainer, I would like to specify a git repo and a tag and then fedpkg take care of the rest. That reduces the work I need to do with dist-git and leaves me more time to focus on bug reports, tracking upstream changes, and submitting patches there. There are a lot of examples like this where small improvements can contribute to improving the developer experience. Fedora needs to treat these problems with a high enough priority to both keep developers interested in working on the project as well as avoiding process fatigue where we feel we have no time to improve things because there&#8217;s so much work to do&#8211;because we have not improved our tools.</li></ul>



<h3>What objectives or goals should FESCo focus on to help keep Fedora on the cutting edge of open source development?</h3>



<p>There is a lot I think FESCo can do here. FESCo should continue to communicate that it is a policy setting body and not a design body. Where a technical decision needs to be made that affects the project as a whole, FESCo should lead that process and get to a conclusion. They do that, but I think this is a definition that bears repeating.</p>



<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>Release policy. I think it is time to revisit how we define and make releases. There is no question that the release cycle is a significant stress factor for the community. I feel that with the introduction of automated testing services and gating tests, we can discuss redefining what a release means and make more of the development asynchronous. For example, if we were to define Fedora releases as coming from a stable tag in git, release engineering, and QA could trust that building a release from that tag would be usable. Releases could then be happening at any point in time that we see fit. They could be rollups of a dot zero release plus updates. This example is hypothetical, but I think the classic Linux distribution release model is something worth discussing and possibly redefining given our new workflow abilities.</li><li>Contributing changes to upstream projects to help with the minimization effort. I have been at Red Hat for a while, and the topic of &#8220;minimizing the install&#8221; is a joint discussion for RHEL and Fedora. Nearly all talks end with it being an intractable problem because you have to agree on what minimal means. That goes beyond just defining the files. It also represents functionality. The minimization efforts underway look like good starts, but I would like to see us work with upstream projects to make more functionality conditional at build time if it is not required or contributing support for building with other libraries. For example, if a program includes HTTP download support, but we decide that it is not part of minimal, we should work to contribute patches that let us build it without libcurl (or whatever the library is).<br>Another example is software with line editing capabilities using readline or libedit. A minimization effort should work to have one line editing library installed, so patches to use that other line editing library help. Too many discussions focus on the built RPMs when minimizing them, but we have made those to enable nearly all functionality and be interdependent. To truly get minimal, we need to think deeper.</li><li>DNF integration with language package managers. I was toying around with this idea earlier in the year, but I think it would be neat to be able to do &#8220;dnf install &#8211;pip PIP_PACKAGE&#8221; or &#8220;dnf install &#8211;cpan CPAN_PACKAGE.&#8221; Integrating these per-language package managers into our system-wide package management could be interesting.</li></ul>



<p>I&#8217;m sure I can think of more here, but I have already written a lot of text.</p>



<h3>What are the areas of the distribution and our processes that, in your opinion, need improvement the most? Do you have any ideas how FESCo would be able to help in those &#8220;trouble spots&#8221;?</h3>



<p>Aside from everything I have already mentioned, I think Fedora should<br>
be working to improve the contributor experience. Helping a new<br>
community member get started in Fedora is confusing for me, and I have<br>
been doing this for a long time. Having a getting started guide, and<br>
current documentation is part of that, but our tools and services<br>
should be more discoverable for new and existing contributors. I<br>
think FESCo could help here by defining some minimum requirements for<br>
developer tools and services. That could also help identify existing<br>
tools and services we should prioritize to bring them up to a better<br>
state.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>



<h3>Describe some of the important technical issues you foresee affecting the Fedora community. What insight do you bring to these issues?</h3>



<p>We have plenty of new stuff happening in package creation and<br>delivery: automatic generation of build requirements and reuse of<br>upstream project metadata, new packaging macros, rawhide gating,<br>library ABI checks, packaging automation like Packit and Modularity,<br>more CI capabilities, rawhide side-tags and gating, new delivery<br>formats like Silverblue, containers, flatpaks, modules. The challenge<br>is how to integrate those technologies into existing workflows so that<br>the old approaches can coexist and be gradually replaced; how to allow<br>hawkish packagers who are ready to switch to the latest and greatest<br>to move forward quickly, without breaking workflows of more<br>conservative maintainers. We also need to keep in mind packaging<br>outside of the core distribution: copr users, spins, distributions<br>which rebuild our packages, people who maintain in-house packages.</p>



<p>We declare that allowing people to build solutions on top of Fedora is<br />
our goal, and we need to weigh the changes that we introduce in this<br />
light.</p>



<p>FESCo does not have the ability to tell people what to do. It is only<br /> useful as a place where questions are asked, and voices of interested<br /> parties are recorded. As a FESCo member my goal will be to ask<br /> questions and gather feedback until any given issue is clear. We can&#8217;t<br /> achieve unanimity, and we can&#8217;t always satisfy everyone, but we need<br /> to anticipate problems and minimize disruption while still allowing<br /> the technology to move forward.</p>



<h3>What objectives or goals should FESCo focus on to help keep Fedora on the cutting edge of open source development?</h3>



<p>In the next two release cycles:</p>



<ul><li>
Make gating finally widely used, by concentrating of general tests<br />
that are applicable to a wide range of packages, to catch<br />
install/uninstall/upgrade issues, library ABI compatibility breaks,<br />
missing dependencies. This will make packaging more robust, and empower<br />
packagers to move on to more interesting tasks.
</li><li>
Finish the transition to Python 3, keep only those Python 2 packages<br />
  that we absolutely must.
</li><li>
Transition to Java 11 and make the Java ecosystem healthy again.
</li><li>
Figure out how to enable the good parts of Modularity, as implemented<br />
now or as equivalent functionality, without making things difficult for<br />
everyone else.
</li></ul>



<p>On slightly longer scale: automatize packaging of language-specific<br />
stacks like Python or Rust by reusing upstream metadata and making the<br />
package creation and update mechanism as simple as possible. Make the<br />
flow from upstream releases to distro packages fully automatic.</p>



<h3>What are the areas of the distribution and our processes that, in your opinion, need improvement the most? Do you have any ideas how FESCo would be able to help in those &#8220;trouble spots&#8221;?</h3>



<p>No big surprises considering what I wrote above: we have a lot of<br />
friction where new technologies are being introduced, and the new<br />
conflicts with the old. Not every project that is brought forward is<br />
ultimately worth integrating in Fedora, and FESCo should ask hard<br />
questions and require contingency plans and coordinate reverts if need<br />
be.</p>



<p>Another problem is the stagnation or even shrinking of the number of<br /> contributors. I believe the technical problems discussed above are<br /> significantly contributing to this: the &#8220;packaging story&#8221; is nowadays<br /> much more complicated and uncertain and less documented than it used<br /> to be; at the same time many experienced packagers are busy fighting<br /> fires and fighting on the mailing lists, so we don&#8217;t have time for<br /> newcomers and docs and polish. This is a problem now, but the upside<br /> is that once those pressing issues are be solved, the experience for<br /> new packagers will improve and we can hope to grow the project again.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>



<h3>Describe some of the important technical issues you foresee affecting the Fedora community. What insight do you bring to these issues?</h3>



<p>One of the big issues I see today is the increasingly large number of  packages that fail to build or install on fedora, which seems to have  about <em>doubled</em> between Fedora 29 and rawhide, according to my  data. I am trying to reintroduce a regular dependency check report for  rawhide (and maybe stable/testing as well), which would at least make  the problem more visible, and provide pointers to the most problematic  missing dependencies.</p>



<p> There&#8217;s also the fallout from the &#8211; currently incomplete (or broken,  depending on who you ask) &#8211; implementation of Modularity, which has  caused upgrade issues (the &#8220;libgit2 issue&#8221;), various issues around the  Java stack, including the broken eclipse packages in fedora 31+ and the  &#8220;forced move&#8221; to modules (or even the recommendation to use the flatpak  version instead), and so on. I&#8217;ve been actively working to keep the  non-modular Java stack maintained under the umbrella of the Stewardship  SIG, so packagers who can&#8217;t (or won&#8217;t) move their packages into modules  don&#8217;t suffer from this current, broken situation.</p>



<h3>What objectives or goals should FESCo focus on to help keep Fedora on the cutting edge of open source development?</h3>



<p>With stagnating contributor numbers and an ever growing package base, I think the most important thing to tackle is making the packager workflow more streamlined. I already see progress being made into the right direction here (for example, making package un-orphaning a push-button action in pagure instead of having to go through a releng ticket manually). This both makes working on fedora packages easier for existing maintainers, and should make fedora a more attractive, modern project to contribute to for newcomers. The multi-build update workflow for rawhide with on-demand side-tags also seems like a good improvement, both for packagers, and for the stability of rawhide. I think a gating check that rejects packages which introduce broken dependencies into the repository would be a good addition, as well (and it might help reduce the number of broken dependencies over time).</p>



<p> Improvements in this area directly benefits the stability of fedora and the ability of packagers to deliver new features faster &#8211; which means fedora can continue to be the best platform for developers.</p>



<h3>What are the areas of the distribution and our processes that, in your opinion, need improvement the most? Do you have any ideas how FESCo would be able to help in those &#8220;trouble spots&#8221;?</h3>



<p>I see a lot of issues surrounding Modularity (both regarding policy and implementation), but that topic has already sparked more debates than any other change in fedora since I joined a few years ago, so let&#8217;s not focus on that for now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Other than that, I see the large (and growing) number of packages with broken dependencies as a big issue, and a sign that the fedora repositories aren&#8217;t in a great state &#8211; not even mentioning the fact that dependencies that aren&#8217;t satisfiable from the official repos might pose a legal risk for fedora, as well.</p>



<p>I think the updated FTBFS and Non-responsive maintainer processes already help here, since they make the problem of broken packages more visible for dependent packagers, and introduce an automatic cleanup of packages that fail to build and that nobody cares about.</p>



<p>Another area that I sometimes find a bit lacking is documentation for some common tasks (like getting a package&#8217;s dependency tree, or querying things that need to be rebuilt in case of ABI changes, …). While there is documentation and policy covering these tasks, it might be good to give concrete examples for correctly determining the impact of a change. This might also help to reduce the number of broken updates (and surprise SONAME bumps) in fedora, making development of rawhide more stable and predictable.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>



<h3>Why are you running for Council?</h3>



<p>I know that it is a great responsibility and also know than the time of my fellow contributors is very valuable so I don&#8217;t want to waste it. I will be in every meeting and commenting on every ticket doing always my best.</p>



<h3>Why should people vote for you?</h3>



<p>I think we can reproduce some ideas becoming from the experience of running the Monthly User/Contributors meetings in Mexico. Those experiences are helping me to grow as a contributor and my skills in teamwork. I&#8217;m feeling than I can do good work in the Council.</p>



<h3>What do you want to accomplish as a member of the Fedora Council?</h3>



<p>My goal is to propose actions that help us increase the number of active collaborators, particularly in packaging, design, and D&amp;I; this will have an impact (at least in theory) on our user base.</p>

<p>In this Blog-Post, I will show how I made email-id case insensitive so that the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server">open-event-server</a> won’t allow multiple accounts with a single handle.</p>



<p>Previously, email ID was stored in the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server">open-event-server</a> database as raw string, i.e., case sensitive, so if a user entered the email with upper case alphabets, he/she needs to enter the same way during Auth, which could have lead to creation of multiple accounts with one email id and so is a major bug.  <br></p>

<p>First, we need to handle the cases on the production database where people have made multiple accounts with a single handle because of this bug. For this, we need to write a complex SQL query, so let’s just make a new migration instead of updating the models.<br></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>def upgrade():  </strong>
<strong>      op.execute("UPDATE users SET deleted_at = current_timestamp, _email =      </strong>
<strong>   concat(_email, '_') where _email not in (SELECT DISTINCT ON (upper(_email)) _email </strong>
<strong>   FROM users);", execution_options=None)</strong></pre>



<p>The nested query will return the list of all Emails which are not distinct on upper(_email). In simple words, the following query says: “Get the _email from users table where upper(_email) is distinct”. We want to delete the emails which are not returned in this query. For that, we set “deleted_at = current_timestamp” for those row.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Make ‘_email’ column case insensitive:</strong></p>



<p>We need to change the column data type to something that treats email as case-insensitive. That’s where “citext” comes into play. But we will still get an error on applying citext to “_email” column.<br></p>



<p>Any guesses why?<br></p>



<p>Remember we just updated “deleted_at” column of duplicate _email rows. So there still exists duplicate entries of emails in case we treat them case-insensitive, which defies the “_email” column rule to have unique entries defined in “user” Model. As it’s never a good idea to delete entries on the production database, we add a “_” to distinguish those email ids.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now the following lines will change the column type of “_email” to citext.<br></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>op.execute("create extension citext;", execution_options=None)</strong></pre>



<p>Now, we need  to write the opposite logic in case someone downgrades from the migration.<br></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>def downgrade():</strong>
<strong>    op.execute("alter table users alter column _email type     text;",execution_options=None)</strong>
<strong>    op.execute("UPDATE users SET deleted_at = null, _email = left(_email, length(_email)-1)        </strong>
<strong>    where right(_email, 1) = '_';",execution_options=None)</strong>
<strong>    op.execute("drop extension citext;",execution_options=None)</strong></pre>



<p>This will solve our bug, and won’t allow multiple accounts from the same handle.<br></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend">Open Event</a> provides filtering while browsing events. These filters are present in a sidebar which also consists of a map. In this blog, I will describe how I implemented the feature to toggle the visibility of the map present in sidebar for mobile devices.<br></p>



<p><strong>About the issue</strong></p>



<p>This issue was part of improvements decided for the browse events section. Earlier the map in sidebar was shown irrespective of the user’s device. It is essentially not required to always show the map in mobile device and is a better choice to provide user with an option to view or hide the map.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3izFcidQXS5nCSSbbKyb8-nuKx3azksnjN8fvmcStIgZrCZg2KjgC7HR6Jz5P_C_AMOTBh_6NVtTW1ZmJzqefb_H6KkpRbvPyX1WUnPQMUzd0Va6SsXGBtq3qyrUQ0QI1OMUnq6M" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Sidebar as viewed from an android device before the fix was merged.<br></p>



<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>



<p>A button is introduced in the mobile view which controls if the map should be visible or hidden. In the sidebar component (app/components/explore/side-bar.js), a variable “isMapVisible” which decides if the map should be visible (if it is true) or not (if it is false) at a particular instant. A new action “toggleMap” is written which changes the value of “isMapVisible” whenever the button is clicked. <br><br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td>isMapVisible = true;<br>@action<br>&nbsp; toggleMap() {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; this.toggleProperty(&#8216;isMapVisible&#8217;);<br>&nbsp; }</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In the handlebar file (app/templates/components/explore/side-bar.hbs), the map and associated text is changed as per the truthy or falsy value of the “isMapVisible” in the component.<br><br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td>&lt;<strong>div</strong> class=&#8221;map item {{if (not isMapVisible) &#8216;mobile hidden&#8217;}}&#8221;&gt;<br><br>{{#<strong>if</strong> device.isMobile}}<br>&nbsp; &lt;<strong>div</strong> class=&#8221;ui bottom attached button&#8221; role=&#8221;button&#8221; {{action &#8216;toggleMap&#8217;}}&gt; {{if (not isMapVisible) &#8216;Show&#8217; &#8216;Hide&#8217;}} Map &lt;/<strong>div</strong>&gt;<br>{{/<strong>if</strong>}}</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>After making the changes, the sidebar looks as follows on the mobile devices<br></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend">Open Event</a> has an event search provided but it lacked two of the userful filters which will make searching for an event for a user easier than the current ecosystem. In this blog post, I describe how I implemented filtering of events on the basis of CFP status and Ticket Type.<br></p>



<p><strong>About the issue</strong></p>



<p>Addition of these two filters were subparts of improving the browse events page better. The browse events page currently functions in an optimal way but these improvements make it even better.<br></p>



<p><strong>How the filters are added</strong></p>



<p>For adding these two filters, it was required that the request sent to server to filter the event must contain ticket type and cfp so that the results from the server can be received. To achieve this, the frontend code needed the following changes:</p>



<ol><li>Passing of request variable into sidebar component present in app/templates/explore.hbs and addition of a clear filter for the same in the same file.e startDate=start_date endDate=end_date location=location ticket_type=ticket_type}</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td>{{explore/side-bar model=model category=category sub_category=sub_category event_type=event_type startDate=start_date endDate=end_date location=location ticket_type=ticket_type}}<br>{{#<strong>if</strong> filters.ticket_type}}<br>&nbsp; &lt;<strong>div</strong> class=&#8221;ui mini label&#8221;&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; {{ticket_type}}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;<strong>a</strong> role=&#8221;button&#8221; {{action &#8216;clearFilter&#8217; &#8216;ticket_type&#8217;}}&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;<strong>i</strong> class=&#8221;icon close&#8221;&gt;&lt;/<strong>i</strong>&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/<strong>a</strong>&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;/<strong>div</strong>&gt;<br>{{/<strong>if</strong>}}</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<ol><li>Adding UI for both the filters in app/templates/components/explore/side-bar.hbs. Accordion UI is used to achieve this.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp; &lt;<strong>div</strong> class=&#8221;item&#8221;&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; {{#<strong>ui-accordion</strong>}}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;<strong>span</strong> class=&#8221;title&#8221;&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;<strong>i</strong> class=&#8221;dropdown icon&#8221;&gt;&lt;/<strong>i</strong>&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {{t &#8216;Ticket Type&#8217; }}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/<strong>span</strong>&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;<strong>div</strong> class=&#8221;content menu&#8221;&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;<strong>a</strong> href=&#8221;#&#8221;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; class=&#8221;link item {{if (eq ticket_type &#8216;free&#8217;) &#8216;active&#8217;}}&#8221;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {{action &#8216;selectTicketType&#8217; &#8216;free&#8217;}}&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {{t &#8216;Free&#8217;}}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/<strong>a</strong>&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;<strong>a</strong> href=&#8221;#&#8221;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; class=&#8221;link item {{if (eq ticket_type &#8216;paid&#8217;) &#8216;active&#8217;}}&#8221;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {{action &#8216;selectTicketType&#8217; &#8216;paid&#8217;}}&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {{t &#8216;Paid&#8217;}}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/<strong>a</strong>&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/<strong>div</strong>&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; {{/<strong>ui-accordion</strong>}}<br>&nbsp; &lt;/<strong>div</strong>&gt;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<ol><li>Editing the routes (app/routes/explore.js) to make sure if the request has new filter parameter then it should be sent to server.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td>if (params.ticket_type) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; filterOptions.push({<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; name : &#8216;tickets&#8217;,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; op &nbsp; : &#8216;any&#8217;,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; val&nbsp; : {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; name : &#8216;type&#8217;,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; op &nbsp; : &#8216;eq&#8217;,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; val&nbsp; : params.ticket_type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; });<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<ol><li>Addition of new request parameter in the controller (app/controllers/explore.js)</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td>queryParams&nbsp; : [&#8216;category&#8217;, &#8216;sub_category&#8217;, &#8216;event_type&#8217;, &#8216;start_date&#8217;, &#8216;end_date&#8217;, &#8216;location&#8217;, &#8216;ticket_type&#8217;],<br><br>ticket_type&nbsp; : null,<br><br>if (filterType === &#8216;ticket_type&#8217;) {&nbsp;&nbsp;this.set(&#8216;ticket_type&#8217;, null);<br>}</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<ol><li>Editing the sidebar component to set the value of request parameter when the user interacts with the filter.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td>hideClearFilters: computed(&#8216;category&#8217;, &#8216;sub_category&#8217;, &#8216;event_type&#8217;, &#8216;startDate&#8217;, &#8216;endDate&#8217;, &#8216;location&#8217;, &#8216;ticket_type&#8217;, function() {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return !(this.category || this.sub_category || this.event_type || this.startDate || this.endDate || this.location || this.ticket_type !== null);<br>}),<br><br>selectTicketType(ticketType) {<br>&nbsp; this.set(&#8216;ticket_type&#8217;, ticketType === this.ticket_type ? null : ticketType);<br>},<br><br>this.set(&#8216;ticket_type&#8217;, null);</td></tr><tr><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Whenever an application is created, it needs an “About Section” for people to know about who built the app. But a lot of about sections forget to give credit to the open-source libraries they use among other things. This blog post will describe how to create a good about section for an open-source android app, by making an example of the about section made in <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/badge-magic-android">Badge Magic Android</a>.<br></p>



<p>The about section is composed of multiple card views, each card view representing one section. The first card view contains the app icon along with some basic details of what the app does. Mention is made of the developers of the app by providing a link to the contributor&#8217;s page of the application. This is a really important part in order to give credit to the contributors of the app who helped build it.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The proceeding section is another card view that gives additional information about the app. Here a link is provided to the GitHub repo of the app in order to help new contributors join and also help users report any issues they face with the app. Here, links to social media pages of the application such as Twitter, Facebook, etc can also be provided.<br></p>



<p>Then comes the last section, the one which generally gets missed out. Being an Open source application, the license of the application and the open-source libraries used should also be given credit. In this section, this is what is done. The license has been provided, which in this case is the Apache License 2.0. Then come the open-source dependencies. Since a lot of these are used in most open source apps, all cannot be mentioned in the card view itself. Here we use a special type of dialog, LisenceDialog to show all the dependencies the licenses used by these dependencies. To make use of the licenseDialog, just add the following line to the gradle of the app:<br></p>



<p>implementation &#8216;de.psdev.licensesdialog:licensesdialog:2.0.0&#8217;</p>



<p></p>



<p>Once this is done, dependencies can be added to the dialog in the form of notices. Each notice contains the name of the dependency, the link to where it is hosted and the license it uses. There is already a collection of all licenses provided included in the licencesDialog dependency and it just has to be called. For example, if the moshi dependency has to be shown in the dialog, it’s notice is added as follows:<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td>val notices = Notice()<br><br>notices.addNotice(<br>		Notice(<br>			context?.getString(R.string.moshi),<br><br>			context?.getString(R.string.moshi_github_link),<br>			context?.getString(R.string.moshi_copy),<br>			ApacheSoftwareLicense20()<br>	)<br>)<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Here are a couple of screenshots of how the About Section of Bade Magic looks like:<br></p>

<p>How to manage your repository size and prevent it from getting too large? Sometimes the size of a repository can get too large. This was the case with the Phimp.me and PSLabs Android repositories, which kept the history of apk files for testing in the Git history.<br></p>



<p>Did you ever notice that your repository size keeps increasing? Like your application size might be small, but the size of the repository is too large?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can happen because of a large commit history. Whatever changes that are made to your repo are stored as history. This process of maintaining the history isn’t bad, but it does increase the size of the repo unnecessarily. This might create a problem for contributors who will have to download the bloated repo, while the actual size of the application might be quite small. Due to an enormous amount of contributions to the Phimp.me and PSLab&nbsp; the repository, their size increased too much. The Phimp.me repo grew to a staggering 600+mb, while the application is just around 20mb. This creates problems for new contributors because to work on an application that is just 20mb, they have to spend more than half a GB of data. Not only new contributors but sometimes existing contributors might also have to clone the repo again and to do so they would have to waste a lot of time and data. Therefore, a repo must be maintained in such a way that the size is not much bigger than the application on which the work is to be done.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>To get the repo size back under control, we used a tool called <strong>bfg repo cleaner</strong>. The advantage of using this tool is that the commit history does not get erased, and all contributors get credit for the changes they made.</p>



<p>So the first step to do is to find the files in the git history which are causing the repo size to be increased. This can be done using a handy command given below:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td>git rev-list &#8211;objects &#8211;all | git cat-file &#8211;batch-check=&#8217;%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)&#8217; | sed -n &#8216;s/^blob //p&#8217; | sort &#8211;numeric-sort &#8211;key=2 | cut -c 1-12,41- | numfmt &#8211;field=2 &#8211;to=iec-i &#8211;suffix=B &#8211;padding=7 &#8211;round=nearest</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This command will give all the files comprising the git history in an order such that the files towards the last will the ones with the largest size. Here, you can see which large files are bloating the repo size. The files that are not being used any longer or are refreshed every time a change is made in the repo can be safely deleted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, let’s take Phimp.me into consideration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The files which were causing the increase in size were the redundant apk files, gradle files and old screenshots of the app that used to be in the readme but were not in use anymore. Using the above command, we got all these files and deleted them using bfg.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can download the bfg.jar file from <a href="https://search.maven.org/classic/remote_content?g=com.madgag&amp;a=bfg&amp;v=LATEST">here</a>. Once this is done, to delete files and folders using bfg, the commands needed are:<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td>java -jar bfg.jar &#8211;delete-files &lt;file name&gt;java -jar bfg.jar &#8211;delete-folders &lt;folder name&gt;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>To make your work easier, you can maintain <strong>bfg</strong> as an alias for <strong>java -jar bfg.jar.</strong></p>



<p>Using this command deletes the required files. Once that is done, force push the changes to your repo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s it. This way you can easily maintain the size of your repo and keep deleting the extra files that cause a rrepo to bloat without erasing the commit history.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/phimpme-android/issues/2820">Here</a> is the link to the entire discussion of the issue on the Phimp.me project where you might find several other insights into the process especially while doing it for repos with android apps.</p>



<p>After doing the entire process, the size of Phimp.me was brought down to 27mb from 600mb.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td>git clone https://github.com/fossasia/phimpme-android<br>Cloning into &#8216;phimpme-android&#8217;&#8230;<br>remote: Enumerating objects: 6304, done.<br>remote: Counting objects: 100% (6304/6304), done.<br>remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4674/4674), done.<br>remote: Total 23695 (delta 4285), reused 3539 (delta 1622), pack-reused 17391<br>Receiving objects: 100% (23695/23695), 27.10 MiB | 6.19 MiB/s, done.<br>Resolving deltas: 100% (14248/14248), done.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2>Where *Brainz is going</h2>



<h3>Engineering</h3>



<p>Engineering efforts can be divided into two sub-categories: <strong>Code</strong> and <strong>Infrastructure</strong>.</p>



<h4>Code</h4>



<p>Future steps for code are focused around genres, user script engagement, API key design, and an editing system overhaul.</p>



<p><strong>Genres</strong> are an eternal topic across the MetaBrainz Summits, but now, they finally exist and are implemented in the front-end and back-end. There was some talk about whether MusicBrainz should be deciding what is or is not a genre; some UPF MTG datasets (<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/ismir2004-genre">ISMIR2004 Genre dataset</a>, <a rel="noopener" href="https://zenodo.org/record/2553414#.XFlWVM17mUk">MediaEval AcousticBrainz Genre</a>) were mentioned, which collect genres and map them in some way to MBIDs. Aliases for genres are also planned, but there are still some edge cases to consider, like whether an alias could apply to two genres.</p>



<p><strong>User script engagement</strong> comes from MetaBrainz wanting a better integration of MusicBrainz with popular user scripts. The team recognized the usefulness of user scripts to create popular tweaks and changes to the viewing or editing experience of MusicBrainz data. Not only do they help other users, but it also gives the development team feedback of popular features to add into MusicBrainz properly. The concerns highlighted here were around scripts that perform mass edits across multiple releases; with great power, comes greater responsibility if implementing something like this in the database. The team did not come to a closing resolution on how to make this a better collaboration. If you are a member of the user script community, <a href="https://community.metabrainz.org/c/musicbrainz/devel" rel="noopener">we&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on this in Discourse</a>.</p>



<p><strong>API key design</strong> comes from MetaBrainz wishing to have greater understanding who uses our data and how, particularly around the Live Data Feed. The intended approach is to use mandatory API keys for end-users to authenticate with. Part of this is an authentication system question (considering an OAuth2 migration) and how to handle dates and times in the API. Monkey was actioned to formalize a proposal at a later date for moving this conversation forward.</p>



<p>An <strong>editing system overhaul</strong> was one of the most ambitious discussions held at the Summit. The need for an overhaul comes from challenges around scaling and growing the database. It also comes from a discussion about isolating the editing system of MusicBrainz from the actual project; for example, this could enable BookBrainz to use the same editor &#8220;code&#8221; as MusicBrainz, while allowing each to take a different form for their types of data. A <code>git</code>‐like editing system was proposed and some early architecture research was completed by the end of the Summit.</p>



<h4>Infrastructure</h4>



<p>Future steps and projects for infrastructure were around Docker/container orchestration and indexed search.</p>



<p>There are two components to how MetaBrainz uses <strong>Docker and containers</strong>: for local development and production deployment. Local development helps developers run a project on their own hardware and test their changes. Production deployment concerns how containers are deployed in an infrastructure environment. The infrastructure team hopes to standardize on Docker best practices for development. More consistency across projects helps existing contributors jump into new areas or other projects more easily. Another part of this conversation was around <strong>container orchestration</strong> with Kubernetes or OpenShift, but more research is needed to understand the cost-value of doing this work. There is limited bandwidth for the infrastructure team to take on new projects and meet current demands.</p>



<p>YvanZo started the conversation on <strong>indexed search</strong> by reviewing the <a rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZZfpnXSUhMVWh4FPJgxZbde40jeWDLe2SRdRjrONkIc/edit?usp=sharing">Solr set-up documentation</a>. The discussion moved to the <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/metabrainz/sir">Search Index Rebuilder</a> (SIR) and pending work to improve performance and resource load. <a rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1abk9f755ewoCBvuoxJPRgpFB0qXeICbNuzcqx6DBhcQ/edit#heading=h.r3yjuexvg613">More notes from the discussion</a> are available.</p>



<h3>Community</h3>



<p>The community updates were divided into three pieces: community engagement, documentation roadmap, and Google Code-In.</p>



<h4>Community engagement</h4>



<p>The community engagement discussion started with a map of the MetaBrainz community by Justin W. Flory:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="7665" data-permalink="https://blog.metabrainz.org/how-to-get-involved-with-metabrainz/" data-orig-file="https://musicbrainz.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/how-to-get-involved-with-metabrainz.png" data-orig-size="1560,1500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="How to get involved with MetaBrainz" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Created by Justin W. Flory, CC BY-SA 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://musicbrainz.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/how-to-get-involved-with-metabrainz.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://musicbrainz.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/how-to-get-involved-with-metabrainz.png?w=1560" src="https://musicbrainz.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/how-to-get-involved-with-metabrainz.png" alt="A flowchart of the MetaBrainz community, pointing to different pathways of getting involved: Data contribution, localization, users, code, documentation, mentorship, donations, and community." class="wp-image-7665" /><figcaption>Flowchart of different ways to contribute to MetaBrainz projects. Each pathway describes a contribution type instead of a specific project. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" rel="noopener">CC BY-SA 4.0</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Three different initiatives were suggested as ways to enable existing and new contributors in a variety of ways, not all code-related:</p>



<ol><li>Community index</li><li>Chat bridges</li><li>Advocacy program</li></ol>



<p>The <strong>community index</strong> is a &#8220;point of entry&#8221; for anyone who wants to get involved with a MetaBrainz project. The flowchart above describes the different ways to get involved, but there is not a good pathway for someone to get directed to the best way they can help. An example of what we want to create is similar to <a href="https://whatcanidoformozilla.org/" rel="noopener">whatcanidoformozilla.org</a> or <a href="https://whatcanidoforfedora.org/" rel="noopener">whatcanidoforfedora.org</a>. This is still a discussion in progress, but if you are interested, please vote and/or comment on <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/ORG-36" rel="noopener" title="ORG-36: Plan and implement a community index">JIRA ticket ORG-36</a>.</p>



<p>The MetaBrainz community is deeply rooted in IRC, but IRC is not an easy-to-use tool for everyone. Some folks use IRCCloud as a way to get around this, but for new contributors, IRC is not an accessible platform. One way to get around this is with <strong>chat bridges</strong>. At the Summit, we committed to exploring a chat bridge, possibly between our IRC channels and Telegram groups. An IRC channel would be linked to a Telegram group, so messages in one appear in the other. This is one social experiment we want to try for bringing new people into the MetaBrainz community. Future progress is waiting on an <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/RITlug/teleirc/issues/201">upstream feature request</a> to be implemented.</p>



<p>An <strong>advocacy program</strong> aims to empower the community to present MetaBrainz projects, and their own works linked to MetaBrainz, at various events around the world. This follows models set by other larger community projects that implement a community ambassador or advocacy program. More discussion is needed, but if you are interested in this, please vote and/or comment on <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/ORG-24" rel="noopener" title="ORG-24: Create a resource for enabling community members to do advocating">JIRA ticket ORG-24</a>.</p>



<h4>Documentation roadmap</h4>



<p>How do we make our documentation more useful and practical? See this <a rel="noopener" href="https://community.metabrainz.org/t/documentation-roadmap-how-do-we-build-related-docs-together-what-does-it-look-like/445452">spin-off discussion in the forums</a> for more information. To keep up with future changes, please vote and/or comment on <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/OTHER-350" rel="noopener" title="OTHER-350: Select new framework for documentation">JIRA ticket OTHER-350</a>.</p>



<h4>Google Code-In</h4>



<p>Google Code-in was led by Freso. We quickly jumped to discussions of how to start planning for participation this year. Fortunately, we are able to use last year&#8217;s tasks as a base for writing new tasks this year. We still need help with mentorship and planning, so if you want to get involved with that, please reach out via <a href="https://metabrainz.org/contact">the usual channels</a>.</p>



<h2>Thanks!</h2>



<p>This event would not have been possible without the support of Microsoft. Thank you for supporting the engagements and interactions that support this project in the best possible way.</p>



<p>Thanks everyone who travelled from near and far (and those who couldn&#8217;t be there together with us), brought lots of yummy chocolates, danced Bollywood style during breaks, and helped contribute towards a more <em>Free</em> world of music and technology.</p>

<p>In this Blog-Post, I will show you, the fixing of multiple notification messages getting sent on multiple clicks or display of multiple messages for a single response.</p>



<p><strong>What Caused the Problem?</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wnafrpyC7oBAhUrciykV8uCn1ELU_5LBrD7Yzt2imkzQJ8eUB5vptsKx5UC0EA4fSaCz-2baKcGjgPWLUiBD4FJ00T_rT2hZlF89E16E6YnXKa2xe50ImPu2iOjTNcldMx1AV5Q8" alt="" /></figure>



<p>In our <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend"><em>Open Event Frontend</em></a>, We are using Ember Notify Services to inject notification across the web app to show the notifications. Due to improper error handling on the client side sometimes we get multiple notification messages for a single click or for a single action. As shown in this picture.</p>



<p><strong>How Did we Tackle It ?</strong></p>



<p>Since the following issue was long pertaining, I solved the issue by adding a unique ID to each notification injected through the webapp. Since a unique ID was associated with each notification message, A single notification was getting displayed on each and every action irrespective of number of clicks or number of actions called. If an actions caused two notification to be simultaneously triggered, One of them on the basis of ID is suppressed so that a unique and understandable notification get shown.</p>



<p><strong>Code Snippet:</strong></p>



<p>Before the changes:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>.then(() =&gt; {
          if (state === 'draft') {
            this.notify.success(this.l10n.t('Your event has been published successfully.'));
          } else {
            this.notify.success(this.l10n.t('Your event has been unpublished.'));
          }</code></pre>



<p>After the changes:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>this.notify.success(this.isNewInvite ? this.l10n.t('Role Invite sent successfully') : this.l10n.t('Role Invite updated successfully'), {
            id: 'man_role'
          });
        })
        .catch(() =&gt; {
          this.notify.error(this.l10n.t('Oops something went wrong. Please try again'), {
            id: 'man_role_error'
          });
        })</code></pre>

<p>In this Blog-Post, I will showcase the landing pages on the Android frontend of Eventyay. As the <strong>Eventyay Android App</strong> has been launched on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eventyay.attendee"><em>Play Store</em></a> as well as <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.eventyay.attendee/"><em>F-Droid</em></a>, We needed to make sure users know that they can access all the details regarding their event on their phones too. Now EventYay features two landing pages for each of its mobile apps :<br></p>



<p><a href="https://eventyay.com/attendee-app">EventYay Attendee App&nbsp;</a></p>



<p><a href="https://eventyay.com/organizer-app">EventYay Orga App</a><br></p>



<p>Addition Of Landing Pages was a 3-Step Procedure, which is stated below :<br></p>



<ol><li>) Defining The Needed Routes and Making Space in Footer.</li><li>) Writing the Code and Designing the Layout for the web-page.</li><li>) Writing Integration Tests for both of the pages.</li></ol>



<p>I will explain each one of the processes involved in making <strong>Landing Pages for Mobile Apps</strong> in brief in this Blog-Post.</p>



<h2>1. Defining The Needed Routes and Making Space in Footer.</h2>



<p>To add any web-page in the <a href="http://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend">Open-Event Frontend</a> , we need to define its route in the Application Router File. The code snippet which adds them is:-</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// app/router.js

router.map(function() {
  this.route('login');
  this.route('register');
  this.route('reset-password');
  this.route('attendee-app');
  this.route('organizer-app');</code></pre>



<p>After successfully defining the routes, We need to create the <em>HandleBars</em> for the corresponding routes. To access those routes we need to create a section on <strong><em>EventYay</em></strong><em> </em><em>Footer</em> to show to the users.</p>



<p>The following code will result in showing the links to the <em>landing page in footer-section</em>:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>2. Writing the Code and Designing the Layout for the web-page.</h2>



<p>After successfully defining the routes and links, its time we move on to writing the <em>HandleBars</em> for the above pages. The first design for the page would be the pointing menu offered by <em>Semantic-UI v.2.0</em>, which would describe the current tab.</p>



<p>After the designing of <em>Navigation Menu</em> in the <em>AttendeeApp.hbs</em>, Its time we design the main outlet and the body of the page. The Design of the layout page is based on the <em>Landing Pages Created in Other Platforms Like Event.IO, EventBrite etc</em>. A <em>Mobile View</em> on the right side with the <em>Key Features of The App</em> on the left side</p>

<h3>3. Writing Integration Tests for both of the Pages.</h3>



<p>Since writing test is the most important part of the <em>Development Lifecycle. </em>I preferred to write <em>Acceptance Test</em> instead of <em>Integration Test or Unit Test, </em>As both of the pages created were very simple in functionality. In <em>Acceptance Test</em>, We would be checking the <em>URL For Both Of The Pages</em> in every case <em>After Login or Without Login.</em><br></p>



<p><strong><em>Test For Attendee App :</em></strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>test('visiting /landing-attendee-app without login', async function(assert) {
    await visit('/attendee-app');
    assert.equal(currentURL(), '/attendee-app');
  });

  test('visiting /landing-attendee-app with login', async function(assert) {
    await login(assert);
    await visit('/attendee-app');
    assert.equal(currentURL(), '/attendee-app');
  });</code></pre>

        <p><em>Posted by Aakanksha Chowdhery, Software Engineer</em></p><p>Why does “Yo Google” not work with Google Assistant? After all, it’s only one word different from the phrase “Ok Google”. It’s because Google Assistant is listening for two specific words — or Wake Words. Wake Words are critical to the design of low-power machine learning to process data with a computationally inexpensive model to “wake up” the device for full processing. Audio wake words, such as “Ok Google”, are widely used to wake up AI assistant devices before they process speech using more computationally expensive machine learning models.</p><p>With the availability of low-power cameras, a popular application includes using a vision sensor with a microcontroller to classify when an image frame contains a person (or any object of interest). We refer to this application as Visual Wake Words because it enables a device to wake up when a human is present, analogous to how audio wake words are used in speech recognition.</p><p>Machine learning at the edge refers to models that run on-device, without connectivity to the cloud. As users deploy models on audio sensors or low-power cameras, microcontrollers provide a good compromise as a low-cost computational platform. However, available machine learning models hardly fit the device constraints (in terms of power consumption and processing power) of microcontrollers as detailed in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05721.pdf">paper</a>.</p><p>At <a href="http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/">CVPR 2019</a>, Google organized a new challenge, called the “Visual Wake Words Challenge”, soliciting submissions of tiny vision models for microcontrollers. The challenge was to classify images to two classes (person/not-person) that serves a popular use-case for microcontrollers. Google open-sourced the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/datasets/build_visualwakewords_data.py">Visual WakeWords Dataset</a> derived from the <a href="http://cocodataset.org/">COCO dataset</a>: the label 1 corresponded to at least one person (or object of interest) being present in the image, and the label 0 corresponded to the image not containing any objects from person class.</p><figure><img alt="Visual Wake Words model to detect the presence of a person." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*QQashdLCaDDCBEF-WyB1Tw.png" /><figcaption>Visual Wake Words model to detect the presence of a person.</figcaption></figure><p>Machine learning for microcontroller devices requires re-thinking the model design, accounting for new tradeoffs between memory footprint, accuracy, and compute costs. Typical microcontrollers have extremely limited on-chip memory (100–320 KB SRAM) and flash storage (256 KB–1 MB). The entire neural network model with its weight parameters and code has to fit within the small memory budget of flash storage. Further, the temporary memory buffer required to store the input and output activations during computation must not exceed the on-chip memory. In Visual Wake Words Challenge, researchers designed models with highest accuracy that fit the microcontroller device constraints: model size is less than 250 KB, peak memory usage is less than 250 KB, inference cost is less than 60 million multiply-adds per inference.

<p>In this Blog-Post, I will show how to allow the system to create the same Discount/Access Code for multiple events in the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server">Open Event Server</a>.<br></p>



<p><strong>What was the issue</strong>:</p>



<p>The main problem was that the server used to identify the discount code and access code based on the discount code/access code itself, which did not allow multiple events to have the same discount/access codes.<br></p>



<p>Can you think of a better solution to this?<br>Yes, we should have been searching for it based on the discount/access code as well as the event they are associated with.<br></p>



<p><strong>Changing the endpoint:</strong></p>



<p>Now to do so, we want to pass the id of the event as well as discount/access code itself with the endpoint so that we can search the database based on the event_id and the code itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Changes in Discount/Access Code Endpoint:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong><code>'/event/&lt;int:discount_event_id&gt;/discount-code/&lt;code&gt;'</code></strong><br><strong><code>'/event/&lt;int:access_event_id&gt;/access-code/&lt;code&gt;'</code></strong></pre>



<p><strong>Change logic for database search:</strong></p>



<p>Now when searching for discount/access code in the database, we need to pass the event_id along with the discount/access code, so that we can get the column of discount/access code associated with that event, even if we have multiple discount/access code with the same name for a different event.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Changes in Database search logic:<br></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong><code>access = db.session.query(AccessCode).filter_by(code=kwargs.get('code')</code></strong><br><strong><code>event_id = kwargs.get('access_event_id')).first()</code></strong></pre>



<p></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong><code>discount = db.session.query(DiscountCode).filter_by(code=kwargs.get('code'),</code></strong><br><strong><code>event_id = kwargs.get('discount_event_id')).first()</code></strong></pre>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Change endpoint in API docs and update Dredd hooks:</strong></p>



<p>Now that we have changed the endpoint to get a discount/access code, we need to change API docs as well as Dredd hooks to accommodate the change in API docs.<br></p>



<p>Changes in API docs:<br></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong><code>## Get Discount Code Detail using the code [/v1/event/{event_id}/discount-code/{code}]</code></strong><code><br></code></pre>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong><code>## Get Access Code Detail using the code [/v1/event/{event_id}/access-code/{code}]</code></strong><code><br></code></pre>



<p>Changes in Dredd Hooks:<br></p>



<p>In discount code hook:<br></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong><code>discount_code.event_id = 1</code></strong><code><br></code></pre>



<p>In access code hook:<br></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong><code>event = EventFactoryBasic()</code></strong><br><strong><code>db.session.add(event)</code></strong><br><strong><code>db.session.commit()</code></strong></pre>

        <h3>Hugging Face: State-of-the-Art Natural Language Processing in ten lines of TensorFlow 2.0</h3><p><em>Hugging Face is the leading NLP startup with more than a thousand companies using their library in production including Bing, Apple, Monzo. </em><strong><em>All examples used in this tutorial are available on Colab. The links are available in the corresponding sections.</em></strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7i5LhQ33_EdxMaPu3iteQg@2x.png" /></figure><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><p>Hugging Face is an NLP-focused startup with a large open-source community, in particular around the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">Transformers</a> library. 🤗/Transformers is a python-based library that exposes an API to use many well-known transformer architectures, such as <strong>BERT</strong>, <strong>RoBERTa</strong>, <strong>GPT-2</strong> or <strong>DistilBERT</strong>, that obtain state-of-the-art results on a variety of NLP tasks like text classification, information extraction, question answering, and text generation. Those architectures come pre-trained with several sets of weights. Getting started with Transformers only requires to install the pip package:</p><pre>pip install transformers</pre><p>The library has seen super-fast growth in PyTorch and has recently been ported to TensorFlow 2.0, offering an API that now works with Keras’ fit API, TensorFlow Extended, and TPUs 👏. This blog post is dedicated to the use of the Transformers library using TensorFlow: using the Keras API as well as the TensorFlow TPUStrategy to fine-tune a State-of-The-Art Transformer model.</p><h3>Library &amp; Philosophy</h3><p>Transformers is based around the concept of pre-trained transformer models. These transformer models come in different shapes, sizes, and architectures and have their own ways of accepting input data: via tokenization.</p><p>The library builds on three main classes: a configuration class, a tokenizer class, and a model class.</p><ul><li><strong>The configuration class: </strong>the configuration class hosts relevant information concerning the model we will be using, such as the number of layers and the number of attention heads. Below is an example of a BERT configuration file, for the pre-trained weights bert-base-cased. The configuration classes host these attributes with various I/O methods and standardized name properties.</li></ul><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/fbc4e947327509f8a10f2c46002020e0/href">https://medium.com/media/fbc4e947327509f8a10f2c46002020e0/href</a></iframe><ul><li><strong>The tokenizer class</strong>:<strong> </strong>the tokenizer class takes care of converting python string in arrays or tensors of integers which are indices in a model vocabulary. It has many handy features revolving around the tokenization of a string into tokens. This tokenization varies according to the model, therefore each model has its own tokenizer.</li><li><strong>The model class:</strong> the model class holds the neural network modeling logic itself. When using a TensorFlow model, it inherits from tf.keras.layers.Layer which means it can be used very simply by the Keras’ fit API or trained using a custom training loop and GradientTape .</li></ul><h3>Joy in simplicity</h3><p>The advantage of using Transformers lies in the straight-forward model-agnostic API. Loading a pre-trained model, along with its tokenizer can be done in a few lines of code. Here is an example of loading the BERT and GPT-2 TensorFlow models as well as their tokenizers:</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/7ab04fc38cbf2651152aa50b17df00b7/href">https://medium.com/media/7ab04fc38cbf2651152aa50b17df00b7/href</a></iframe><p>The weights are downloaded from HuggingFace’s S3 bucket and cached locally on your machine. The models are ready to be used for inference or finetuned if need be. Let’s see that in action.</p><h3>Fine-tuning a Transformer model</h3><p>Fine-tuning a model is made easy thanks to some methods available in the Transformer library. The next parts are built as such:</p><ul><li>Loading text data and pre-processing it</li><li>Defining the hyper-parameters</li><li>Training (with Keras on CPU/GPU and with TPUStrategy)</li></ul><h4>Building an input pipeline</h4><p>We have made an accompanying <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l39vWjZ5jRUimSQDoUcuWGIoNjLjA2zu">colab notebook</a> to get you fast on track with all the code. We’ll leverage the<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/">tensorflow_datasets</a> package for data loading. Tensorflow-dataset provides us with a <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset">tf.data.Dataset</a> , which can be fed into our <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/processors.html#transformers.data.processors.glue.glue_convert_examples_to_features">glue_convert_examples_to_features method</a>.</p><p>This method will make use of the tokenizer to tokenize the input and add special tokens at the beginning and the end of sequences (like [SEP], [CLS], &lt;/s&gt; or &lt;s&gt; for instance) if such additional tokens are required by the model. This method returns a tf.data.Dataset holding the featurized inputs.</p><p>We can then shuffle this dataset and batch it in batches of 32 units using standard tf.data.Dataset methods.</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/fda0e93b3a54edfc85ee81b1b5d75857/href">https://medium.com/media/fda0e93b3a54edfc85ee81b1b5d75857/href</a></iframe><h4>Training with Keras’ fit method</h4><p>Training a model using Keras’ fit method has never been simpler. Now that we have the input pipeline setup, we can define the hyperparameters, and call the Keras’ fit method with our dataset.</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/c4c1e4f63aacf71e0863c56f4aabd79e/href">https://medium.com/media/c4c1e4f63aacf71e0863c56f4aabd79e/href</a></iframe><h4>Training with Strategy</h4><p>Training with a strategy gives you better control over what happens during the training. By switching between strategies, the user can select the distributed fashion in which the model is trained: from multi-GPUs to TPUs.</p><p>As of the time of writing, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/TPUStrategy">TPUStrategy</a> is the only surefire way to train a model on a TPU using TensorFlow 2. Building a custom loop using a strategy makes even more sense in that regard, as strategies may easily be switched around and training on multi-GPU would require practically no code change.</p><p>Building a custom loop requires a bit of work to set-up, therefore the reader is advised to open the following colab notebook to have a better grasp of the subject at hand. It does not go into the detail of tokenization as the first colab has done, but <strong>it shows how to build an input pipeline that will be used by the TPUStrategy.</strong></p><p><strong>This makes use of Google Cloud Platform bucket as a means to host data</strong>, as TPUs are complicated to handle when using local filesystems. <em>The </em><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yWaLpCWImXZE2fPV0ZYDdWWI8f52__9A#scrollTo=mnhwpzb73KIL"><em>colab notebook is available here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h4>Transformers now has access to TensorFlow APIs - So what?</h4><p>The main selling point of the Transformers library is its model agnostic and simple API. Acting as a front-end to models that obtain state-of-the-art results in NLP, switching between models according to the task at hand is extremely easy.</p><p>As an example, here’s the complete script to fine-tune BERT on a language classification task(MRPC):</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/33ad175ce13adda7617db781867a3373/href">https://medium.com/media/33ad175ce13adda7617db781867a3373/href</a></iframe><p>However, in a production environment, memory is scarce. You would like to use a smaller model instead; switching to DistilBERT for example. Simply change the first two lines to these two in order to do so:</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/772c31c23c14727b116b2354e8a8c3f9/href">https://medium.com/media/772c31c23c14727b116b2354e8a8c3f9/href</a></iframe><p>As a platform hosting 10+ Transformer architectures, 🤗/Transformers makes it very easy to use, fine-tune and compare the models that have transfigured the deep-learning for NLP field. It serves as a backend for many downstream apps that leverage transformer models and is in use in production by many different companies. We’ll welcome any question or issue you might have on our <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/new/choose">GitHub repository</a>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=102445cda54a" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/tensorflow/using-tensorflow-2-for-state-of-the-art-natural-language-processing-102445cda54a">Using TensorFlow 2 for State-of-the-Art Natural Language Processing</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/tensorflow">TensorFlow</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><br>fastlane is the easiest way to automate beta deployments and releases for Android apps. We are going to see how we used fastlane in <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/badge-magic-android">fossasia/badge-magic-android</a> to automate almost everything inside our project.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<h2>Fastlane Configuration</h2>



<p>In Badge Magic, fastlane is integrated to deploy apps on Playstore as well as F Droid. This is a very straightforward method to manage both things from a single perspective.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3WcXpP57hpV6-IUO1Au3DXOH65zOBGTZ7IP8jbA1Cf-ak-Zq5RZr6VoIfROXcpUXui24dNMDLvM_gavlvoYpkOM5vXyzJLPfcH2oTHUAaXBcIPmgJ-FbtGG7lWw9u3x2IXRzrQzx" alt="" /></figure>



<p>This is the hierarchy of the fastlane folder and it specifies the following:</p>



<ul><li>Metadata:</li></ul>



<p>This folder holds the information regarding the project and every other resource such as images, changelogs, descriptions.</p>



<p>Every time we publish anything using the fastlane command, it checks the files and uploads the changes on every build.</p>



<ul><li>AppFile:</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">json_key_file("./scripts/fastlane.json") # Path to the json secret file - Follow https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/supply/#setup to get one
package_name("org.fossasia.badgemagic") # e.g. com.krausefx.app</pre>



<p>AppFile is responsible for specifying the path of the google json and the package name of the project.</p>



<ul><li>Fastfile:&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>This is by far the most important file which handles almost everything with respect to scripting. Let’s have a look in more detail.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<h2>Fastfile</h2>



<p>Fastfile contains all the code required to run lanes and define the tasks that need to be performed.</p>



<p>In this file, we first define the platform we are going to work on. In our case it is android, therefore:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">default_platform(:android)</pre>



<p>Let’s create a lane which builds the aab package for our deployment. We can specify the gradle task with the type which needs to be performed when we run a specific lane.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">lane :buildAAB do
    gradle(task: "bundle",build_type: "Release")
end</pre>



<p>Let&#8217;s create another lane which uploads the aab package from our build directly to the play store server.&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">lane :uploadToPlaystore do
    upload_to_play_store(track:"alpha",aab:"apk/badge-magic-master-app.aab")
end</pre>



<p>This uploads the aab present in the specified directory to the playstore. So finally our final Fastfile looks like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">default_platform(:android)
platform :android do
    lane :buildAAB do
        gradle(task: "bundle",build_type: "Release")

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Fastlane is amazing and it automates almost everything for you. Fastfile is written in ruby and you can code lane dependencies, condition builds and anything you can think of when it comes to build automation.</p>



<p>Using fastlane we integrated 2 app stores without any hassle or code duplication.</p>

<p>In this blog, we are going to have a look on how I created this badge preview in <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/badge-magic-android">fossasia/badge-magic-android</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<h2><strong>What is Canvas?</strong></h2>



<p>Canvas is a class in Android that performs 2D drawing of different objects onto the screen. The saying “a blank canvas” is very similar to what a Canvas object is on Android. It is basically, an empty space to draw onto.</p>



<h2><strong>Canvas Coordinate System</strong></h2>



<p>The coordinate system of the Android canvas starts in the top left corner, where [0,0] represents that point. The y axis is positive downwards, and x axis positive towards the right.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Some basics of Canvas, lets see how we drew this Preview Badge.</p>



<p>The Badge consists of only 2 components:</p>



<ol><li>Rounded Rectangle ( Background )</li><li>Normal Rectangles ( LED Lights )</li></ol>



<p>Let’s see how we create rounded rectangles in android.&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">// Draw Background
canvas.drawRoundRect(bgBounds, 25f, 25f, bgPaint)</pre>



<p>Using drawRoundRect() we can easily create the badge background. 25f specified is the corner radius of the rectangle.</p>



<p>The LED Lights are just drawable resources which are used according to the current state of the LED.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">private fun drawLED(condition: Boolean, canvas: Canvas, xValue: Int, yValue: Int) {
   if (condition) {
       ledEnabled.bounds = cells[xValue].list[yValue]
       ledEnabled.draw(canvas)
   } else {
       ledDisabled.bounds = cells[xValue].list[yValue]
       ledDisabled.draw(canvas)
   }
}</pre>



<p>This function draws the LED Lights if the condition is satisfied.<br></p>



<p>When we consider a custom view, we need to consider the changes which occur according. These layout changes are to be controlled and maintained accordingly, Let’s see how we manage the positioning of the led lights for every android device. Spoiler: Simple 10th Grade Maths xD</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">override fun onLayout(changed: Boolean, left: Int, top: Int, right: Int, bottom: Int) {
   super.onLayout(changed, left, top, right, bottom)
   val offset = 30
   val singleCell = (right - left - (offset * 3)) / badgeWidth
   val offsetXToAdd: Int = ((((right - offset).toFloat() - (left + offset).toFloat()) - (singleCell * badgeWidth)) / 2).toInt() + 1

   cells = mutableListOf()
   for (i in 0 until badgeHeight) {
       cells.add(Cell())
       for (j in 0 until badgeWidth) {
           cells[i].list.add(Rect(
               (offsetXToAdd * 2) + j * singleCell,
               (offsetXToAdd * 2) + i * singleCell,
               (offsetXToAdd * 2) + j * singleCell + singleCell,
               (offsetXToAdd * 2) + i * singleCell + singleCell
           ))
       }
   }
   bgBounds = RectF((offsetXToAdd).toFloat(), (offsetXToAdd).toFloat(), ((singleCell * badgeWidth) + (offsetXToAdd * 3)).toFloat(), ((singleCell * badgeHeight) + (offsetXToAdd * 3)).toFloat())
}</pre>



<p>We create an offset which is nothing but the gap from the screen edge to the badge itself, now we need to have gaps on both sides of the badge and we also leave half the offset inside the badge which is the difference between the badge background and the LED starting point, hence we calculate the value of single cells by:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">val singleCell = (right - left - (offset * 3)) / badgeWidth</pre>



<p>We minus the no of pixels on the right of the display to the left, to get the width of the actual screen. Then we minus the padding from the left and right which is offset * 3 . Now we divide it by the number of cells we want in the badge which is the badgeWidth.</p>



<p>Once we have the number of cells, we want to calculate the left, right, top and bottom positions of all the LED. What we now do is loop into the number of LEDs and then multiply the singleLed width with the current position to get the accurate pixels which need to be escaped from the left.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cells = mutableListOf()
   for (i in 0 until badgeHeight) {
       cells.add(Cell())
       for (j in 0 until badgeWidth) {
           cells[i].list.add(Rect(
               (offsetXToAdd * 2) + j * singleCell,
               (offsetXToAdd * 2) + i * singleCell,
               (offsetXToAdd * 2) + j * singleCell + singleCell,
               (offsetXToAdd * 2) + i * singleCell + singleCell
           ))
       }
   }
</pre>



<p>Now the fun part, we save all of it in a 2D ArrayList to be able to draw it later on.<br></p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Working on custom views is very unique. This experience is one of a kind and drawing stuff with basic maths is fun in the first place. Simple equations led me to create a preview which simulates the complete badge in software.&nbsp;</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Posted by Daniel Smilkov, Sandeep Gupta, and Vishy Tirumalashetty</em></p><p><a href="http://tensorflow.org/js">TensorFlow.js</a> is an open-source library that lets you define, train, and run machine learning models in Javascript. The library has empowered a new set of developers from the extensive JavaScript community to build and deploy machine learning models and enabled new classes of on-device computation. TensorFlow.js runs in all major browsers, server-side in Node.js, and as of recently, in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-wechat">WeChat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-react-native">React Native</a> providing hybrid-apps access to ML without having to leave the JS ecosystem. Today, we are excited to bring a new way for JavaScript developers to easily train a custom model on your own data and deploy it in your JavaScript application using the GCP AutoML service.</p><p>One of the main goals behind TensorFlow.js is to empower JS developers to use the benefits of ML without having to create their own models. There are two existing ways to bring the power of ML to your JavaScript applications: use one of our pre-packaged models, or fine-tune a model on your own data.</p><p>For example, our pre-packaged <a href="https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5">Pose estimation</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/tensorflow/introducing-bodypix-real-time-person-segmentation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-f1948126c2a0">Body segmentation</a> models allow you to build <a href="https://twitter.com/teropa/status/1001151524351959041">new forms of user interaction</a> and can form the basis for new <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/creatability">accessibility tools</a>. All of these models are published on NPM and you can use them with a few lines of code (no ML knowledge required!):</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/59ef70f67a812addee794523ec1faa84/href">https://medium.com/media/59ef70f67a812addee794523ec1faa84/href</a></iframe><p>If you have your own data, you can start with a pre-trained model and fine-tune it. The pre-trained models and the training itself can live in Python or JavaScript. If the training is done in Python, you can seamlessly convert the SavedModel or Keras model to TensorFlow.js using our <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter#getting-started">converter</a>. If the model is already in TensorFlow.js, you don’t need to do any conversion. <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-teachablemachine-codelab/index.html#0">This codelab</a> shows you how to take MobileNet, an image classification model optimized for edge devices, and fine-tune it on your own image dataset, all in JavaScript.</p><h4><strong>TensorFlow.js + AutoML</strong></h4><p>We are excited to announce the integration with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs/">Cloud AutoML Vision</a>, a Cloud service that enables developers to train a custom model on their labelled data. If your use-case is related to image classification or object detection, you can use the UI to upload your data, train an edge model and directly export it to a TensorFlow.js model, without any coding. Note that custom models can be directly trained using the open-source TensorFlow.js library (or Python TensorFlow), but AutoML provides an easy-to-use service that automates this process for you.</p><figure><img alt="TensorFlow.js model" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*NyEo0SUJOJKE26c6" /></figure><p>To make it easy to deploy and run the models efficiently in TensorFlow.js, we published a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs-automl">@tensorflow/tfjs-automl</a> library on NPM. Once you export the model, you can follow our step-by-step guides for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs/tensorflow-js-tutorial">image classification</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/object-detection/docs/tensorflow-js-tutorial">object detection</a>. The guides use the NPM library and show you how to load the pre-trained model in the browser and make a prediction on an image.</p><p>If you already have a custom model, AutoML can still be incredibly useful. AutoML Vision Edge models are optimized to a small memory footprint and offer low latency while delivering high accuracy. We worked with several customers and partners and got some amazing early results and feedback. <a href="https://www.cvpcorp.com/">CVP</a>, a business and technology consulting company, has been evaluating some vision scenarios to help with workplace safety on edge-based models used in remote locations. Here is what Cal Zemelman, Director of Data science at CVP said on their results:</p><p><em>“We are working on a smartphone app for a Federal agency that performs image classification to help prevent accidents and improve public safety. The app is mainly written in JavaScript as a Progressive Web App to allow cross-platform usage, so we were training a Keras model and converting it afterwards to TensorFlow.js. With the new “Export to TensorFlow.js” feature, we were able to test out using AutoML to greatly streamline our model creation workflow. Previously, our best model was a retrained ResNet50 which got to about 91% accuracy. The middle of the road balanced performance model from AutoML Image Classification hit ~99% accuracy in 5 node hours. It is also 1/5 the size of the previous model and we saw a 60% improvement in the speed of inference.”</em></p><p>We are very excited about the early results our customers and partners are seeing and look forward to hearing more with this release.</p><p>You can train an AutoML Vision Edge model today. Once you train the model, you can export the TensorFlow.js model to your client-side application. With AutoML Vision Edge, you only pay for training for any usage beyond 15 node hours you get for free.

      <div class="content">
        <p>Someone signing up to edit a Wikipedia page for the first time may feel a bit like a visitor to a new planet—excited, to be sure, but wildly overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Many new editors must wonder: Just how many millions of articles are in this vast online resource? And which of those millions of articles need that particular person’s help?</p>
<p>More than 10,000 users open accounts on Wikipedia each day, and the English language version alone contains nearly six million articles. Many new users give up before they start, however, intimidated by how many different ways there are to get started, and how challenging it can be to learn to edit. Wikipedia wants their help, of course; its success requires an engaged community of contributors,  providing wisdom at all levels to enhance the product and enrich the greater good.</p>
<p>With the goal of increasing new users’ engagement, the <a href="https://research.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Foundation Research team</a> and their collaborators in the <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/">Data Science Lab</a> at EPFL, a technical university in Switzerland, undertook a study to see how Wikipedia might solve this so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_start_(computing)">cold start</a>” problem. How, by asking a few simple questions at the outset of someone’s volunteering as an editor, it could nurture and coax that person, guiding them to the places where their expertise could be most helpful—easing them into the experience, and making it satisfying enough to encourage them to stick around. They <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03889.pdf">published the results</a> in the proceedings of the Thirteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2019).</p>
<h2>Assembling data without feedback</h2>
<p>Wikipedia needs to start by asking questions because of an age-old problem: Because the users are only just then signing up, Wikipedia doesn’t yet know anything about them, and can’t immediately guide them to a soft landing in their area of interest.</p>
<p>Moreover, other sites, like Amazon, Facebook, YouTube or Spotify, immediately generate a wealth of data on their users, from things they buy, to things they “like,” to things they watch or listen to (and how long they watch or listen), to things they recommend.</p>
<p>That’s <em>explicit feedback</em>. Wikipedia, however, has an <em>implicit feedback </em>system. It must infer from its data how a user feels about one of its articles, which is harder to do; if someone edits an article, do they like it? Or do they contribute in order to fix the issues they see in the article, even though they  are not necessarily interested in the subject? You can’t tell.</p>
<p>To set up its recommender system, the researchers sought to establish a questionnaire for new editors. Researchers had a general architecture in mind. They didn’t want to ask too many questions, fearing a burdensome process would turn people away. So they wanted to get as accurate a preference as possible, as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The main concept was to have pre-loaded lists of articles that users could react to: “I want to edit articles in list A, but not list B.” The lists, the researchers knew, would have to have articles that were distinctive enough for the preferences to be meaningful. Once a user identified enough lists, the engine would have the data to extract articles that need editing that—hopefully—align with the user’s interests.</p>
<p>With that structure in mind, researchers considered populating lists based on the content of Wikipedia articles. That’s an obvious choice, but it carried a drawback: some words have multiple meanings, and putting it in a list wouldn’t necessarily answer the question of the user’s interest.</p>
<p>The other option was picking topics based on how much editing they had received, which researchers called the “collaborative” method. That, too, had a drawback.  Some topics get a lot of edits because they may have a lot of typos, for instance, while important topics may be non-controversial and not generate so many edits.</p>
<p>So the researchers decided to use a little bit of both the content method and the collaborative method, to leverage both of their strengths. That involved a complex series of calculations, ultimately optimized into a series of lists that could be presented to new editors.</p>
<p>One list might include the musicians Elvis Costello, Stevie Nicks, and Eddie Vedder. Another could itemize entries on the cities Sikeston, Missouri; Selma, Alabama; and Baltimore, Maryland. One list could feature scientific terms, such as <em>Apomecynini</em>, <em>Desmiphorini</em>, and <em>Agaristinae</em>, while another list offered other terms, like affective computing, isothermal microcalorimetry, and positive feedback.</p>
<p>Each term in a list would be related to another. As new users chose one list compatible with their interests and rejected others outside their expertise, the system would then learn which types of Wikipedia entries to ask those users to help edit.</p>
<h2>Reaction from users</h2>
<p>Getting to that point took a lot of complicated math and computer science, partly because the researchers didn’t want to mess with the actual workings of Wikipedia. (The site has a policy: “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_laboratory">Wikipedia is not a laboratory</a>.”)</p>
<p>Once the surveys were established and the research project <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Voice_and_exit_in_a_voluntary_work_environment/Elicit_new_editor_interests">fully described on Wikimedia’s Meta-Wiki</a>, the researchers launched the experiment. They took all the users who signed up for an account on English Wikipedia from September to December 2018 and divided them into two sets: those with more than three edits, and those with three or fewer edits.</p>
<p>Once the groups were further sliced and diced, they were sent questionnaires of 20 questions each, in which each “question” was actually a comparison of two lists of 20 articles each—an extension of the illustration above. Once the users made their selections, they received 12 lists of recommendations, each with five articles to read or edit.</p>
<p>After meticulously analyzing the responses, the researchers found that the users were generally satisfied with the recommendations. Naturally, they also found room for improvement. For instance, they could do a better job of distinguishing whether users are editors or readers, and tailoring recommendations that way. And they could make recommendations for articles that really need editing, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub">stubs</a> or articles of low quality.</p>
<p>Another fix could be a timesaver for the users. Each question took about a minute to answer; the entire process took 20 minutes. That may drive some users away, but the researchers theorized that they could simply allow a user to answer as many questions as they would like.</p>
<h2>Long term changes</h2>
<p>In this experiment, researchers focused only on making sure the recommendations were of high quality, and that the users were satisfied. They did not get at the bigger question the work is designed to ensure: Will the users stay on the site? In the future, the researchers will need to see if they can improve retention, but noted that “will need to be a different and longer experiment.”</p>
<p>One alternative to the questionnaires could be establishing connections with other Wikipedia users. If the researchers pair a new user with other new users with similar interests, they might form a group that would collectively contribute to Wikipedia. And if they pair a new user with a veteran editor, that person could serve as a mentor to help them along.</p>
<p>Anything that encourages new users to stay and contribute should also help diversity Wikipedia. “The gender and ethnicity distribution of active Wikipedia users is currently very biased, and having a system for holding the hands of newcomers can help alleviate this problem,” the researchers noted.</p>
<p>If you like the idea of that—either teaming with other users, or having a mentor—please let us know, and maybe we can arrange it. Perhaps you’ll be part of the next experiment!</p>
<p>And if you’re a new user, we look forward to playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions">20 Questions</a> with you!</p>

        <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this month’s Partner Spotlight we are featuring <a href="https://fiter.io">Fiter</a> &#8211; one of our most globally distributed partners. Fiter truly exemplifies the collaborative spirit of the community as it was borne out of the partnership between two long-time Mifos community members, Robert Jakech and Javier Borkenztain. As the team continues to bring on customers from fintechs and financial institutions around the globe, their team has continued to grow, with Mifos community members joining their team, as well as brining fresh new talent into the community. Fiter is active throughout the community and committed to being a lead contributor to Mifos and Fineract. They are also one of our first partners to make a financial commitment back to the long-term sustainability of the Mifos Initiative by pledging a portion of their revenues as a donation. </span></i></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This regular blog series will shine the light on some of our top Partners. Not only do we want to recognize them for their accomplishments, we want others to learn from the approach they’ve taken to promote and implement Mifos.</span></em></p>
<p><em><a href="https://fiter.io"><img class="alignright wp-image-7491 size-full" src="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fiterlogo-1.png" alt="" width="346" height="180" srcset="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fiterlogo-1.png 346w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fiterlogo-1-300x156.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" /></a></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take some time to learn more about Fiter directly from their team.</span></p>
<h2><b>Overview of the Partner Organization</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://fiter.io">Fiter &#8211; Financial Technologies Revolution</a> &#8211; is an industry-leading innovator that creates, distributes and supports enterprise-ready open source core and digital banking platforms for financial institutions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiter was founded in 2017 when our founders Robert Jakech and Javier Borkenztain partnered to create the company with the mission of bridging the gap between finance and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both our  founders were involved in the Mifos community for many years and had been working on Mifos projects in Latin America for a couple of years before founding Fiter. Fiter’s founders are based in Uruguay and Australia with our first client  in Mexico and our first delivery team in Uganda. Since then, we haven’t stopped growing as a distributed company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now have clients in Europe, the Americas, APAC and Africa and a team spread across 12 cities. Our clients includ Fintechs, MFIs, Banks and other companies that leverage bespoke solutions on top of the Mifos and Fineract stacks. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What Motivates Your Contributions?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a community, we are mandated to give back. We receive a lot from the community, and to give back is not just a question of retribution, rather than a moral mandate. We feel part of a greater community and that’s what makes Mifos and Fineract so special. We strongly believe that community outperforms the individuals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are living in the open-source era, where much more can be achieved with different stakeholders contributing to their places and skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of our efforts to contribute back, we have created a dedicated team to work on open issues for the community and contribute back as much as we can to the upstream project.  </span></p>
<h2><strong>Why did you choose to build a business on top of Mifos/Fineract?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financial industry is being transformed by Fintech. New players are coming to the space and the traditional players need to modernize their tech stack towards open and modern architectures. The open-source nature of Mifos and Fineract creates an ideal framework for that. Open Source is how the software industry creates standard products. Fineract has the mission to become the standard core for the financial industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Core and digital banking is an industry of $20 billion/year and yet open-source market share still on its infancies and not yet capturing a relevant portion of this market. We foresee that this is going to change soon, and we are ready to lead the change. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What has been the most valuable part of being part of the Mifos community?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having the opportunity to work with people from different parts of the world towards a greater goal of alleviating poverty and improve the lives of billions is what makes us proud. Most of the team members of Fiter came from both open source communities, and that’s amazing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a daily basis, people from Europe, the  Americas, Africa, and Apac interact within Fiter to work on relevant projects across the globe. This multicultural distributed nature of Fiter is possible because the communities, without them, Fiter wouldn’t exist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what is the most valuable part of being part of these open source communities? The people we found in them. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Which customers are you working with right now?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, we have worked and currently work with an array of financial institutions playing across different key markets. To mention a few, we have worked with companies like Banco Compartamos in México and Agros Foundation in Seattle. Currently we have live projects in Mexico, Colombia, Jamaica, España, Israel, Nigeria, Swaziland, Australia and Estonia. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What differentiates your firm from other partners?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiter is the first Mifos and Fineract global partner. We have clients in 13 countries and a team in 12 cities. We have the opportunity to see different trends across many regions and cross-pollinate ideas from our clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our clients are innovators and entrepreneurs that are willing to adopt new technology to create new financial products to alleviate poverty, provide better financial services and innovate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are bringing innovators, Fintech, and others to the community, and that makes us feel very proud. We foresee that these innovators and early adopters will pave the road to bigger actors join our community and capture the huge opportunity. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What opportunities do you see in the market right now?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market opportunity for core and digital banking is almost $20bn per year. History does not repeat, but rhymes, so if we compare the open source trends in other markets (cloud, operating systems, big data….) we can expect to capture a lot of this market within the open-source movement, against the big vendors in the industry, all of them, proprietary software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We see that Mifos and Fineract can capture a significant portion of this market, and bring to the community bigger players. Today, most of the users of Mifos and Fineract are small players with a few but important early adopters as exceptions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for big players to join the community, they need to have professional services or what we call enterprise-ready solutions. They need to have vendors and solution providers that allow them to build and rest assured that the solution will stand for long. We are working on different business propositions to allow these bigger players to receive services and solutions based on a subscription model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, we will dedicate resources to work directly on the upstream projects to improve the offering and perceived quality of the products on the community. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What words of advice would you give to others in the community?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The community outperforms the individuals, so we need to focus on the greater good. The market opportunity is big enough for all of us, so we need to focus on becoming a strong community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market to capture is orders of magnitude bigger than the ones that know about Mifos and Fineract, if we focus on growing as a community and improving the products, we will become the standard stack for the financial industry, as Linux did for the operating systems, Fineract will do for the core and digital baking industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to embrace the concept of coopetition (cooperation + competition), we will compete for some deals, and that is going to happen, but above all, we need to cooperate on the community, on the upstream project and the common goals. A strong and healthy community is the best resource we all have. </span></p>

        <p><em>A guest post by Sandeep Mistry &amp; Dominic Pajak of the Arduino team</em></p><p><a href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a> is on a mission to make Machine Learning simple enough for anyone to use. We’ve been working with the TensorFlow Lite team over the past few months and are excited to show you what we’ve been up to together: bringing TensorFlow Lite Micro to the <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/nano-33-ble-sense">Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense</a>. In this article, we’ll show you how to install and run several new <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers/overview">TensorFlow Lite Micro</a> examples that are now available in the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries#toc1">Arduino Library Manager</a>.</p><p>The first tutorial below shows you how to install a neural network on your Arduino board to recognize simple voice commands.</p><figure><img alt="Running the pre-trained micro_speech inference example." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*53gfZrrBtT1OZ-eH" /><figcaption><em>Example 1: Running the pre-trained micro_speech inference example.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Next, we’ll introduce a more in-depth tutorial you can use to train your own custom gesture recognition model for Arduino using TensorFlow in Colab. This material is based on a practical workshop held by Sandeep Mistry and Don Coleman, an updated version of which is <a href="https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoTensorFlowLiteTutorials/tree/master/GestureToEmoji">now online</a>.</p><figure><img alt="Training your own gesture classification model." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*tTPJtxyn3ozkb4aO" /><figcaption><em>Example 2: Training your own gesture classification model.</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you have previous experience with Arduino, you may be able to get these tutorials working within a couple of hours. If you’re entirely new to microcontrollers, it may take a bit longer.</p><p>We’re excited to share some of the first examples and tutorials, and to see what you will build from here. Let’s get started!</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FHzCRZsGJLbI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHzCRZsGJLbI&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FHzCRZsGJLbI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/b5f85ab7179553edce820a7a39a26968/href">https://medium.com/media/b5f85ab7179553edce820a7a39a26968/href</a></iframe><p><em>Note: the following projects are based on TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers which is currently experimental within the </em><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro"><em>TensorFlow repo</em></a><em>. This is still a new and emerging field!</em></p><h4>Microcontrollers and TinyML</h4><p>Microcontrollers, such as those used on Arduino boards, are low-cost, single chip, self-contained computer systems. They’re the invisible computers embedded inside<em> billions</em> of everyday gadgets like wearables, drones, 3D printers, toys, rice cookers, smart plugs, e-scooters, washing machines. The trend to connect these devices is part of what is referred to as the Internet of Things.</p><p>Arduino is an open-source platform and community focused on making microcontroller application development accessible to <a href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub">everyone</a>. The <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble-sense">board</a> we’re using here has an Arm Cortex-M4 microcontroller running at 64 MHz with 1MB Flash memory and 256 KB of RAM. This is tiny in comparison to Cloud, PC, or Mobile but reasonable by microcontroller standards.</p><figure><img alt="Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NSwaqMt3NSalIRr2p9LnCg.png" /><figcaption><em>Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board is smaller than a stick of gum</em></figcaption></figure><p>There are practical reasons you might want to squeeze ML on microcontrollers, including:</p><ul><li>Function — wanting a smart device to act quickly and locally (independent of the Internet).</li><li>Cost — accomplishing this with simple, lower cost hardware.</li><li>Privacy — not wanting to share all sensor data externally.</li><li>Efficiency — smaller device form-factor, energy-harvesting or longer battery life.</li></ul><p>There’s a final goal which we’re building towards that is very important:</p><ul><li>Machine learning can make microcontrollers accessible to developers who don’t have a background in embedded development</li></ul><p>On the machine learning side, there are techniques you can use to fit neural network models into memory constrained devices like microcontrollers. One of the key steps is the <a href="https://petewarden.com/2016/05/03/how-to-quantize-neural-networks-with-tensorflow/">quantization of the weights</a> from floating point to 8-bit integers. This also has the effect of making inference quicker to calculate and more applicable to lower clock-rate devices.</p><p>TinyML is an emerging field and there is still work to do — but what’s exciting is there’s a vast unexplored application space out there. Billions of microcontrollers combined with all sorts of sensors in all sorts of places which can lead to some seriously creative and valuable Tiny ML applications in the future.</p><h3>What you need to get started</h3><ul><li>An <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/nano-33-ble-sense">Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense</a> board</li><li>A Micro USB cable to connect the Arduino board to your desktop machine</li><li>To program your board, you can use the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software">Arduino Web Editor</a> or install the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software">Arduino IDE</a>. We’ll give you more details on how to set these up in the following section</li></ul><p>The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense has a variety of onboard sensors meaning potential for some cool Tiny ML applications:</p><ul><li>Voice — digital microphone</li><li>Motion — 9-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer)</li><li>Environmental — temperature, humidity and pressure</li><li>Light — brightness, color and object proximity</li></ul><p>Unlike classic Arduino Uno, the board combines a microcontroller with onboard sensors which means you can address many use cases without additional hardware or wiring. The board is also small enough to be used in end applications like wearables. As the name suggests, it has Bluetooth LE connectivity so you can send data (or inference results) to a laptop, mobile app or other BLE boards and peripherals.</p><p><strong>Tip: Sensors on a USB stick</strong></p><p>Connecting the BLE Sense board over USB is an easy way to capture data and add multiple sensors to single board computers without the need for additional wiring or hardware — a nice addition to a Raspberry Pi, for example.</p><h3>TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers examples</h3><p>The inference examples for TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers are now packaged and available through the Arduino Library manager making it possible to include and run them on Arduino in a few clicks. In this section we’ll show you how to run them. The examples are:</p><ul><li>micro_speech — speech recognition using the onboard microphone</li><li>magic_wand — gesture recognition using the onboard IMU</li><li>person_detection — person detection using an external ArduCam camera</li></ul><p>For more background on the examples you can take a look at the source in the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro">TensorFlow repository</a>. The models in these examples were previously trained. The tutorials below show you how to deploy and run them on an Arduino. In the next section, we’ll discuss training.</p><h4>How to run the examples using Arduino Create web editor</h4><p><em>Once you connect your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to your desktop machine with a USB cable you will be able to compile and run the following TensorFlow examples on the board by using the </em><a href="https://create.arduino.cc/editor"><em>Arduino Create</em></a><em> web editor:</em></p><figure><img alt="Compiling an example from the Arduino_TensorFlowLite library" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*iWKllZhC0NtCmOYh" /><figcaption><em>Compiling an example from the Arduino_TensorFlowLite library</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Focus on the speech recognition example: micro_speech</h4><p>One of the first steps with an Arduino board is getting the LED to flash. Here, we’ll do it with a twist by using TensorFlow Lite Micro to recognise voice keywords. It has a simple vocabulary of “yes” and “no”. Remember this model is running locally on a microcontroller with only 256KB of RAM, so don’t expect commercial ‘voice assistant’ level accuracy — it has no Internet connection and on the order of 2000x less local RAM available.</p><p>Note the board can be battery powered as well. As the Arduino can be connected to motors, actuators and more, this offers the potential for voice controlled projects.</p><figure><img alt="Running the micro_speech example" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*PmzGHGpJAwmeZtox" /><figcaption><em>Running the micro_speech example</em></figcaption></figure><h4>How to run the examples using the Arduino IDE</h4><p>Alternatively, you can use try the same inference examples using Arduino IDE application.</p><p>First, follow the instructions in the next section <em>Setting up the Arduino IDE.</em></p><p>In the Arduino IDE, you will see the examples available via the <strong>File &gt; Examples</strong> &gt; <strong>Arduino_TensorFlowLite </strong>menu in the ArduinoIDE.</p><p>Select an example and the sketch will open. To compile, upload, and run the examples on the board, and click the arrow icon:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/616/0*HwEj4ZsTv4n8RR7W" /></figure><p>For advanced users who prefer a command line, there is also the <a href="https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli#arduino-cli">arduino-cli</a>.</p><h3>Training a TensorFlow Lite Micro model for Arduino</h3><figure><img alt="Gesture classification on Arduino BLE 33 Nano Sense, output as Emojis" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*dniZrqwbvHQcYxOn" /><figcaption><em>Gesture classification on Arduino BLE 33 Nano Sense, output as Emojis</em></figcaption></figure><p>Next, we will use ML to enable the Arduino board to recognise gestures. We’ll capture motion data from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board, import it into TensorFlow to train a model, and deploy the resulting classifier onto the board.</p><p>The idea for this tutorial was based on Charlie Gerard’s awesome <a href="https://medium.com/@devdevcharlie/play-street-fighter-with-body-movements-using-arduino-and-tensorflow-js-6b0e4734e118"><em>Play Street Fighter with body movements using Arduino and Tensorflow.js</em></a><em>. </em>In Charlie’s example, the board is streaming all sensor data from the Arduino to another machine which performs the gesture classification in Tensorflow.js. We take this further and “TinyML-ify” it by performing gesture classification on the Arduino board itself. This is made easier in our case as the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board we’re using has a more powerful Arm Cortex-M4 processor, and an on-board IMU.</p><p><em>We’ve adapted the tutorial below, so no additional hardware is needed — the sampling starts on detecting movement of the board. The original version of the tutorial adds a breadboard and a hardware button to press to trigger sampling. If you want to get into a little hardware, you can follow that version </em><a href="https://github.com/sandeepmistry/aimldevfest-workshop-2019"><em>instead</em></a><em>.</em></p><h4>Setting up the Arduino IDE</h4><p>Following the steps below sets up the Arduino IDE application used to both upload inference models to your board and download training data from it in the next section. There are a few more steps involved than using Arduino Create web editor because we will need to download and install the specific board and libraries in the Arduino IDE.</p><figure><img alt="Download and install the specific board and libraries in the Arduino IDE." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*D_EYhyU8LAEpwoxU" /></figure><ul><li>Download and install the Arduino IDE from<strong> </strong><a href="https://arduino.cc/downloads"><strong>https://arduino.cc/downloads</strong></a></li><li>Open the Arduino application you just installed</li><li>In the Arduino IDE menu select<strong> Tools &gt; Board &gt; Boards Manager…</strong></li><li>Search for “Nano BLE” and press install on the board</li><li>It will take several minutes to install</li><li>When it’s done close the Boards Manager window</li></ul><figure><img alt="Boards Manager window" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*iO86dmc2axTkGOWe" /></figure><ul><li>Now go to the Library Manager <strong>Tools &gt; Manage Libraries…</strong></li><li>Search for and install the <strong>Arduino_TensorFlowLite</strong> library</li><li>Next search for and install the <strong>Arduino_LSM9DS1</strong> library:</li></ul><figure><img alt="Library manager" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*mVnKwyO_dVf36-YG" /></figure><ul><li>Finally, plug the micro USB cable into the board and your computer</li><li>Choose the board<strong> Tools &gt; Board &gt; Arduino Nano 33 BLE</strong></li><li>Choose the port <strong>Tools &gt; Port &gt; COM5 (Arduino Nano 33 BLE)</strong></li><li>Note that the actual port name may be different on your computer</li></ul><p>There are more detailed <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/NANO33BLESense">Getting Started</a> and <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> guides on the Arduino site if you need help.</p><h4>Streaming sensor data from the Arduino board</h4><p>First, we need to capture some training data. You can capture sensor data logs from the Arduino board over the same USB cable you use to program the board with your laptop or PC.</p><p>Arduino boards run small applications (also called <em>sketches) </em>which are compiled from <em>.ino </em>format Arduino source code, and programmed onto the board using the Arduino IDE or Arduino Create.</p><p>We’ll be using a pre-made sketch <strong>IMU_Capture.ino</strong> which does the following:</p><ul><li>Monitor the board’s accelerometer and gyroscope</li><li>Trigger a sample window on detecting significant linear acceleration of the board</li><li>Sample for one second at 119Hz, outputting CSV format data over USB</li><li>Loop back and monitor for the next gesture</li></ul><p><em>The sensors we choose to read from the board, the sample rate, the trigger threshold, and whether we stream data output as CSV, JSON, binary or some other format are all customizable in the sketch running on the Arduino. There is also scope to perform signal preprocessing and filtering on the device before the data is output to the log — this we can cover in another blog.

        <p>We are pleased to announce a new $1 million gift to the Wikimedia Endowment from Amazon to support greater access to information for everyone. This is Amazon’s <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2018/09/25/amazon-gift-wikimedia-endowment/?pk_campaign=Sept2019AmazonSecondGift">second gift </a>to the <a href="https://wikimediaendowment.org/">Wikimedia Endowment</a>, a permanent fund dedicated to ensuring the long-term sustainability of Wikipedia and the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/our-work/wikimedia-projects/">other Wikimedia free knowledge projects.</a></p>
<p>When Wikipedia was created in 2001, we made a commitment to grow the quantity and quality of knowledge available worldwide, evolve to meet new demands, and secure our place as a worldwide forum for free knowledge. Many companies use our open content to make their work better and drive their financial goals. We encourage consistent, commensurate support from these organizations to help sustain WIkipedia for the long term.</p>
<p>“We are grateful to Amazon for its continued collaboration and support in ensuring access to information and free and open knowledge, for today and tomorrow’s generations,” said Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2016/01/14/wikipedia-15-foundation-endowment/?pk_campaign=Sept2019AmazonGiftEndowmentLaunch">launch of the Endowment in January 2016</a>, the campaign has raised over $42 million from generous individuals, foundations, and corporations. Amazon’s support provides additional momentum to the Wikimedia Endowment campaign and to our belief that free knowledge must be safeguarded and available to anyone, anywhere. Through its enduring support, Amazon is helping us come closer to ensuring that Wikipedia and free knowledge remain available without restriction for generations to come.</p>
<p>“This gift signals Amazon’s commitment to ensuring Wikipedia will continue to thrive for years to come,” said Lisa Seitz Gruwell, Wikimedia’s Chief Advancement Officer. “We’re thrilled to see Amazon continue to invest in the long-term vision where every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.”</p>

        <p>The face of Wikipedia’s volunteer community is often an editor—someone who maintains, edits, and writes facts in the vast online encyclopedia. But editors aren’t the only contributors to Wikipedia, WikiCommons, and the other Wikimedia projects: there are many other volunteers who contribute by organizing events and inspiring others to join our volunteer community. Their work, though not as overtly visible, is also incredibly important and vital to the growth of our movement.</p>
<p>Wikimedia organizers help recruit, train, support, and organize the community, and invite new contributors and allies, like librarians, educators, and activists, to fill gaps and create content in the projects. They also facilitate thousands of projects and events each year to introduce new contributors to Wikimedia, shaping the movement that supports Wikipedia and its sister projects in innumerable ways.</p>
<p>As the Wikimedia Foundation focuses on our movement&#8217;s <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Direction">strategic direction</a>, we anticipate needing to know more about how to support and grow this community of organizers. When the strategic direction <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Direction#We_will_welcome_people_from_every_background_to_build_strong_and_diverse_communities.">describes</a> needing to invite allies, partners, and a more diverse set of communities into the movement, it also implies the Wikimedia <em>movement </em>needs more <em>organizers</em> to facilitate this work and organize new contributors.</p>
<p>During the first half of this calendar year, the Wikimedia Foundation&#8217;s Community Engagement and Product departments conducted a research project, called <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Movement_Organizers">Movement Organizers</a>.  We worked with the consultancy Concept Hatchery to produce design research materials like personas and research findings which will help both departments better design programs, technology and support structures for the growing community of organizers. We have now published the research, and you can find it from our portal on <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Movement_Organizers">Meta-Wiki</a>, in both <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikimedia_Movement_Organizers_Study_es.pdf">Spanish</a> and <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikimedia_Movement_Organizers_Study.pdf">English</a>.</p>

<h3>Understanding movement organizers</h3>
<p>The Movement Organizers research project tries to understand a globally diverse community that supports the Wikimedia movement. It was important to us that the research represent a broad range of different communities from different parts of the world, while also reflecting the unique challenges that some of our communities face. Therefore we interviewed 55 organizers, half of which were remote with members of our communities around the world, and half from deep local studies in Argentina and Ghana.</p>
<p>Despite organizers in Argentina, Ghana, and the rest of the world experiencing very different contextual and social conditions, many things remained consistent including the journeys organizers experience joining the community, the roles organizers play, the teams that organizers build around themselves, the tools they use, and challenges they face. This allowed us to both create design research materials that are both generically useful, but also pose questions and highlight conditions that support opportunities for organizers in different contexts.  Interviews in Ghana and Argentina also highlighted how complex social and cultural conditions create very locally specific variations on these broad trends.</p>
<p>After developing these shared definitions, frameworks and a number of more nuanced recommendations, we highlighted three broad principles for supporting organizers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Energize the existing Wikimedia community to organize by designing catalyzing experiences that encourage people towards committed organizing.</li>
<li>Invest in building alignment with people outside the movement to increase the participation of invited Organizers.</li>
<li>Retain Organizers by increasing motivation and decreasing challenges.</li>
</ol>
<p>We think that by designing with these core principles in mind, the movement can grow our community of organizers and strengthen the capacity of the movement to organize and support communities. As Concept Hatchery’s Ana Chang observed after doing the research: “the organizers we met have built so much community with so little resources. With a little intentional support, we can stabilize and empower them to truly develop strong local communities for Wikimedia.”</p>

<h3>Building on a foundation of design research</h3>
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_61943"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="size-full wp-image-61943" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Wikimedia-Movement-Organizers-Study-es-page-89.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="724" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption">A fictional persona from our Spanish Language version of the Movement Organizers report. Personas help staff and community members create a mental image of who they are trying to support.</span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
<p>The Movement Organizers research follows on what the Wikimedia Foundation learned from two previous design research projects<sup>[1]</sup>: <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/New_Editor_Experiences">New Editor Experiences</a>, focused on new editors to Wikimedia projects, and <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/New_Readers">New Readers</a>, focused on readers in markets not well supported by the Wikimedia movement. Both of these projects have informed the work of teams within the Wikimedia Foundation toward better supporting and informing new Wikipedia readers and new Wikipedia editors.</p>
<p>“When we talk with and learn from people in their context, in such a focused way, our work is more easily organized around the needs and motivations of those people and communities,&#8221; says Abbey Ripstra, a Lead Design Researcher at the Wikimedia Foundation. &#8220;This kind of research informs our teams and departments about what people need in order to access and contribute to free knowledge, and what we might do to better fulfill, or support those needs being fulfilled.”</p>
<p>Though the development of the New Readers, New Editors, and Movement Organizers research was largely unrelated, Ripstra sees an overarching pattern behind them. “We started with our biggest unknown audience (new readers), and it was a natural step to focus next on new editors. Now, we’re moving on to learning more about movement organizers, which is a smaller community that makes a huge difference in the effectiveness of the larger community.”</p>
<h3>What can you do with the research?</h3>
<p>The Wikimedia movement’s 2030 strategy process will soon be publishing recommendations that focus our collective effort on trying to reach our <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Direction">movement direction</a>. This direction is ambitious: focused on becoming a central infrastructure for free and open knowledge. To make this audacious move, we, as a movement, need to design greater pathways and support structures for the organizers we have, and invite new organizers to strengthen our movement.</p>
<p>Because the research is foundational research, we expect different organizations and communities to be able to leverage or respond to it differently. For example, The Wikimedia Foundation’s Community Engagement department is pairing parts of the research with the finding from previous <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Community_Capacity_Development">Community Capacity Development research</a>, to build training and help organizers to better understand their own work in light of the larger movement. We are excited that the research also provides a common framework for Product and Community Engagement to design tools to support organizers. Additionally, we hope that groups throughout the movement will use this research to design their own support programs.</p>
<p>The research also prompts a number of questions about growing the movement to meet the strategic direction: by focusing on the organizers who have already joined our movement, we weren’t able to do deep research into the organizers who have not been invited to the movement, or have yet to have an opportunity to join the WIkimedia community.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about the research, have questions, or would like help integrating the research into your own planning or design processes, please let us know on the <a href="https://discuss-space.wmflabs.org/c/research">Wikimedia Discuss Space</a> or <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Movement_Organizers">on Meta</a>!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">[1] <em>Design research</em> is a practice based on observing, listening to, and learning from people in the contexts in which they live and work. Solutions to problems and addressing opportunities are more successful if they are designed around the goals and needs, challenges and accomplishments of the people being designed for.</p>

      <h5>2019-10-03T17:00:47.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Wikimedia Foundation</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The Wikimedia Foundation is excited to announce the appointment of Amanda Keton as General Counsel. Amanda brings more than a decade of legal, nonprofit management, and compliance experience to the role. She will join the organization on 7 October.</p>
<p>The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates Wikipedia and other free knowledge projects. Together, Wikipedia and the Wikimedia projects are visited by around 1.5 billion unique devices every month. The Wikimedia Foundation is driven by its vision of building a world in which every single person can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.</p>
<p>“Advocacy is a crucial part of our work in advancing free knowledge,” said Katherine Maher, Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation. “Now more than ever, we must recognize the urgency in fighting for policies and protections to make knowledge more open. Amanda’s extensive experience in advocacy and public policy, and her passion for fighting for equity and social change, make her an excellent fit to lead the advocacy work for our movement.”</p>
<p>As General Counsel, Amanda will work closely with the executive team to develop and build the organization in service of the future of our projects. She will advise the Executive Director on legal and policy matters and serve as Secretary to the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation. Amanda will direct the Foundation’s defensive litigation and public policy agenda around the world, while supporting and cultivating a diverse team of experts and leaders across the Legal department.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m thrilled to join the Wikimedia movement and help bolster the work of its dedicated community,” Amanda said. “Increasing access to knowledge, defending our community and users, curbing surveillance and censorship, facilitating open policy discussions, and advocating for privacy are among the defining issues of our time. Wikimedia is poised to play a leading role in shaping them in collaboration with people everywhere who are driving forward our goal of free knowledge for all.”</p>
<p>Prior to joining Wikimedia, Amanda was General Counsel of Tides Network, a national public foundation deploying donor-advised grants and investments to build a world of shared prosperity and social justice. While in that role, she worked with the Wikimedia Foundation to establish the Wikimedia Endowment, a source of funding to support the Wikimedia projects and mission in perpetuity. She also served as Head of Tides Foundation and People Operations as well as CEO of Tides Advocacy, the policy affiliate in the Tides family of organizations.</p>
<p>Before her work at Tides, Amanda worked for Ernst &amp; Young providing nonprofit organizations with consulting, advisory, and compliance services.</p>
<p>Amanda serves on the Network for Good Board, which supports companies and organizations to target, retain, and engage donors through a variety of services. She previously co-chaired the Board of Directors for the San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Community Center during a period when they tripled their affordable nonprofit rental space and co-located service providers to help the Center’s program participants thrive in San Francisco. She also formerly served on the Board of Directors for the ACLU of Northern California and Equal Rights Advocates.</p>
<p>Amanda completed a Master of Arts in Education while teaching middle school and wrote her thesis on why culturally and linguistically diverse students opt out of gifted and talented programs. Amanda is a member of the California State Bar and graduated with a Master of Laws in Taxation cum laude and Juris Doctor from the University of San Diego School of Law. She is based in San Diego.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Another Google Summer of Code has come and gone again and as our intern community grows it&#8217;s hard to keep up with sharing back with the community the product of their efforts. This year we worked with our biggest class of Mifos Initiative GSOC interns with 14 and also worked directly with 2 Apache Fineract GSOC interns and 2 Outreachy interns with the support of DIAL. Apart from the valuable code contributions our interns make, they are a critical organic growth engine for the community which has helped to yield some of our most impactful contributors to the community like Avik Ganguly of Fynarfin. So give them a big shout-out via the lists or social media and encourage them to keep on contributing and fighting poverty with financial inclusion.</p>
<p>This year our students worked across the entire stack from back to front-end on top of both of generations of Mifos/Fineract. On our mobile apps, we added new functionalities, enhanced the user experience, integrated with external payment systems and did refactoring across our mobile field operations app for Fineract and Fineract CN, our Mifos Mobile mobile banking apps for Finerct and Fineract CN, our mobile wallet app, and a new Fiinwallet app contributed by Fintecheando. On the web app front, we had two interns continue rewriting the web app into the latest version of Angular and continued enhancing our Online Banking App. On the back-end we hardened Fineract by tackling some of the backlog, updated our Swagger API documentation, integrated our payment hub with the GSMA mobile money APIs and continued to push the frontier of new innovation with enhancements to our chatbot, machine learning-based scorecard, and a new mobile app to capture the PPI using cloud vision and automated detection of objects in images. On the back-end of Fineract CN, we completed the removal of Category X dependencies to prepare for a 1.0 release of Fineract CN. Our Outreachy interns worked on our community infrastructure by migrating our Mifos mailing lists to a Discourse forum and our user manual to a Gitbook user manual.</p>
<p>This post highlights their work with links to their final reports. We&#8217;ll also be conducting a couple showcases to demo their work so please register for the Showcase on October 4 or the Showcase on October 8 at 1300GMT via Zoom Webinar.  Our reflections post will soon follow to help you get to know these interns and keep them immersed and involved in the community.</p>

<h2>Thank You!</h2>
<p>Before we take a closer look at the results of the summer, we want to first off thank everyone who made Google Summer of Code another successful year.</p>
<h3>Google Open Source Programs Office</h3>
<p>First off we want to once again thank the Google Open Source Programs office for giving us the opportunity to participate once again in Google Summer of Code. Our mentors, Rahul and Tarun, are looking forward to seeing the entire team at the Mentor Summit in Germany this October!  We are always impressed by the awesome job they do in coordinating such a massive global collaboration handling all the moving pieces so smoothly. We look forward to participating in GCI and GSOC for many years to come!</p>
<h3>Mentors &amp; Co-Org Admin</h3>
<p>A huge thank you to all our mentors who are the most critical piece of the puzzle in having a successful Google Summer of Code. Without our mentors being there at each step of the way to help guide our students in their journey, we couldn&#8217;t get through the summer. A big thank you to Rahul Goel especially for stepping up as Co Org-Admin and really being on top of ensuring all our student evaluations were submitted on time by mentors. We are eager to grow our mentor participation for next year so welcome any community members who&#8217;d like to make the leap, to step forward now!</p>
<p>Thank you to our mobile development mentors &#8211; Rajan Maurya, Tarun Mudgal, , Naman Dwivedi, Abhilash G, Anamika, and Ishan Khanna. Thank you to our web development mentors &#8211; Gaurav Saini, Pranjal Goswami, Kelvin Okome, and Ankit Ohja.  Thanks to our mentors on the platform side &#8211; Avik Ganguly, Nayan Ambali, Aleksandar Vidakovic, Lalit Mohan, Steve Conrad, Courage Angeh, Rahul Goel, Sanyam Goel, Raul Sibaja, Karina Munoz, and Victor Romero. Thank you to our Fineract CN mentors &#8211;  Isaac Kamga. Thank you to Courage and Ruphine for their Outreachy mentorship.</p>
<h3>DIAL &amp; Outreachy</h3>
<p>Thank you to DIAL for supporting one of our Outreachy interns and to the Outreachy general fund for supporting the other &#8211; the meaningful contributions our interns made will greatly impact the community.</p>
<h3>Our Interns</h3>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, thank you to our interns from across the globe who poured their energy into their projects. This year they were ever-perseverant in working on brand new codebases, changing requirements on the fly, and working on experimental solutions. What is always most rewarding is seeing how collaborative and supportive the interns are of each other helping to solve coding problems, helping with collaboration tools and just being great all-around community members. <span style="font-weight: 400;">We wish them the best of luck in whatever they pursue next and look forward to their continued contributions to the Mifos Initiative. Already, despite the program being officially over, many of our interns have continued making contributions and wrapping up loose ends of their projects. </span></p>

<h2><b>Mobile Apps</b></h2>
<p>We had a total of six interns working on our mobile apps across both Fineract and Fineract CN. For our Mifos X mobile apps, Mifos Mobile 4.0 is now ready to support external payment systems and is more skinnable, our Android Client 6.0 is further refactored with additional functionalities, our Mobile Wallet 3.0 framework continues to be extended to be a valuable foundation for mobile wallet apps, and we now have a hybrid wallet app, FiinWallet that has been contributed by Fintecheando. For our apps on Fineract, we continued refactoring both Finearct CN Mobile 3.0 and Mifos Mobile CN 2.0. Mifos Mobile CN 2.0 is now prepared to consume the soon to be released Open Banking APIs via our API gateway.    <span style="font-weight: 400;">These are great reference apps to demo what Mifos and Fineract can support but they’re also great “starting dough” for any partner looking to see what can be built on top of Mifos X or Fineract CN  and wanting a reliable open source foundation to start from.</span></p>

With the payment hub and API Gateway now in place, next we look to add additional mobile money and. payment system integrations into the app as well as having the app connect via the Open Banking API rather than the self-service APIs. Take a look at everything Prashant worked on in his <a href="https://gist.github.com/prashantkh19/ee02d6955ee17c3e44e6253c175caf97">final report on Gist</a>.</p>

<h3><b>Mobile Wallet Framework 3.0 &#8211; Shivansh Tiwari </b></h3>
<p><a href="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-26-at-11.58.59-AM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-7424 alignleft" src="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-26-at-11.58.59-AM.png" alt="" width="216" height="223" srcset="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-26-at-11.58.59-AM.png 216w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-26-at-11.58.59-AM-36x36.png 36w" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px" /></a>Shivansh worked under the guidance of Naman Dwivedi and was able to accomplish a substantial amount including improving user experience and redesigning the app, support for Kotlin, integration with two Mojaloop transaction flows via the Paymeht Hub, adding improving Deeplinks, support for standing instructions and more well-rounded support for merchant transactions.  On the UX front, Shivansh added filters to improve searching history, added additional search bars, improved QR Code generation and scanning, refactored the sign up process to include a password strength checker and password display option, and redesigned the receipt view with support for generating a PDF.  The app now supports deep links for receipts and invoices which allow URLs to open up directly in the wallet application with support for auth handling when the user hasn&#8217;t entered his/her passcode.   Standing instruction support is now provided whereby new standing instructions can be created and existing ones viewed.  Integrating with external payment systems like mobile money will soon be possible now that the payment hub has been integrated supporting two Mojaloop use cases, a peer to peer transfer via MSISDN and merchant payment via dynamic QR code. The mobile wallet now provides an even more robust framework to either manage a consumer or agent-facing wallet for a mobile money or wallet operator or to build a consumer wallet to unify multiple transactional accounts in one interface.  On the roadmap is integrating with the Hover SDK for USSD Automation, and using the API Gateway to more securely connect to Fineract or Fineract CN. We are eager to identify users who would like to provide use cases to further develop the mobile wallet.  Please view gifs for each enhancement in <a href="https://gist.github.com/shiv07tiwari/acb5a7266fe685e8332498fd32b00bf0">Shivansh&#8217;s gist final report.</a></p>

Moksh added improvements to a number of the views including displaying mobile number and group name in client details as well as ability to add a photo while creating a new client.  The entire project has been migrated to Android X (Jetpack) making it consistent with our other Android apps &#8211; support for Kotlin has also been added. On the functional side, a major enhancement is the implementation of the checker inbox allowing users to view a list of tasks and bulk approve, create, disburse, etc. Lastly Moksh added support for fingerprint authentication and made it part of the passcode library so now any of our Android apps can also utilize fingerprint authentication.

Abhijit added a significant amount of new functionality and screens to enhance user experience and began preparing the app for connecting securely to Fineract CN via the soon-to-be-released API gateway providing support for an Open Banking API. Abhijit improved the app from all regards including the client page, the loans and deposits pages, as well as upgrading the app to Android X, the rebranded support libraries provided by Google. Enhancements include the ability for the client to upload and edit their profile photo and a new customer details page to review their current loan and savings products and all their details including ID cards, current status, and recent activities. When applying for a loan, a client can now review details of the loan application before submitting. The amount of information available via the loan and deposit details pages has now been greatly expanded to include all details, plus viewing of the repayment schedule and debt to income report; likewise details of deposit accounts can now be viewed. An About Us page was also added to the repo, a Gitter channel and Travis CI badge.

On the architectural side, to make Fineract CN mobile an offline first app, integration with Couchbase is needed. Saksham has begun the migration from REST API calls to Couchbase calls starting with syncing functionality for Customers that can be carried over to other modules of the app. Search functionality previously relied on REST calls back to the server but now it can be done by filtering locally on the Android device. The ability to create new groups via the app has been added along with the ability to view details for Accounts, Ledgers, Tellers, and Products. A settings section to the app has now been added, a new splash screen, and the app is now integrated with the passcode library.

Just like Abhay, apart from re-implementing the screens, he had to spend large efforts on refactoring to improve the re-usability and consistency of the code. Abhay began his project by upgrading the Mifos X web app and all of its dependencies to the latest version, Angular 7. Abhay also created a custom component for creating forms dynamically in a dialog to replace the current approach where form fields were being added to a dable.  Since Abhay was focused on the product pages, he also implemented pipes to assist with filtering and integrated with Angular Material Stepper for a consistent wizard-like view while filling out long forms like product creation; previously the entire code for actions for a stepper were cluttered in a single file &#8211; code readabilty and re-use has now been greatly improved.

<h3><b>Mifos X Web App Rewrite &#8211; Jivjyot Singh</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-9.48.47-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-7430 alignleft" src="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-9.48.47-PM.png" alt="" width="241" height="253" srcset="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-9.48.47-PM.png 336w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-9.48.47-PM-286x300.png 286w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jivjyot spent his summer continuing the rewrite of the Mifos X web app into the latest version of Angular, that Anwesh and Abhay began last summer. With Pranjal, Gaurav, and Kelvin providing supports mentors, Jivjyot focused primarily on rewriting the screens related to clients in Mifos X. His project began with mockups for a redesigned client dashboard page and unifying client and account creation workflows under that. In implementing the new clients UI, Jivjyot had to significantly refactor it to follow coding standards throughout the app including removing partially implementing components, using HttpClient to make API requests, and updating the routing so dynamic bread crumbs would work properly. On the view clients page, to make the UI consistent when navigating amongst different client-level tabs, all the actions were added to the header. Jivjyot’s thoroughness on this project is manifest on the back-end, where he took the initiative to add ehancements to the global stylesheet for storing color related scss variables. Apart from creating the new view client page in the latest version of Angular, Jivjyot also re-implemented the client list page with server side pagination and a togggle to show/hide closed client. He also re-implemented the family members list and adding family member pages, the address tab, the identities tab, the documents tab, the notes tab, and data tables tab. Jivjyot looks forward to continuing his project and will be improving the search implementation and working on the import clients workflow.

Being such a frontier project, there were some delays in getting access to enough images to train the model as well as well as full support for the PPI in Mifos X and Fineract. Despite not completing her project fully, Apoorva still accomplish an immense amount and learned even more with the support of her mentors, Rahul, Nayan, and Ishan. Some of the major learnings that Apoorva took away from this summer included extending her proficiency in Android development including her first introduction to Kotlin and famliarization with new libraries such as Work Manager and Retrofit, image augmentation techniques and the AutoML object detection feature on the Google Cloud platform, and how to write production-level code and healthy development practices.  Throughout the summer, Apoorva created the code for a brand new Android app, Vision PPI, with authentication via the Fineract platform APIs, a homepage with client search using the Fineract APIs, a user profile, a basic client profile page with the ability to take a new survey, the ability to take a picture from the camera or gallery and uploaded it to the Google Cloud vision model where it will detect objects found in the image. Due to not having access to specific household images, Apoorva had to train her model on detecting basic objects but now has the foundation in place to continue extend the project along with the support of the Mifos community and the IPA team guiding the PPI.

Dylan impressed us all with the thoroughness of his development and how intensively he debugged each of the issues he was assigned. Since this was his first time working on a large codebase having to navigate dozens of classes instead of just a few and was learning new domain terminology related to microfinance, Dylan began by creating a Spring Boot app to familiarize himself. From there, Dylan took on the investigation and debugging of several critical and complex issues from the backlog: Fineract-615 to resolve an Amazon S3 issue related to administration configuration error, fixing Fineract-609 to implement group top-up loan functionality by identifying and fixing the error where the server was not sending the Java array containing the IDs of active group loan accounts to be closed, Fineract-722 fixing the issue where certain integration tests only fail on the first day of the month, and Fineract-723 to fix the issue where certain integration tests would fail when run on a system whose time zone was not the same as the tenant’s.  To view the PRs, details for all these fixes, and discussions on the mailing list, see Dylan’s gist at </span><a href="https://gist.github.com/DylanRobson/5353817529f37d477f3b480dc0166343"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://gist.github.com/DylanRobson/5353817529f37d477f3b480dc0166343</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

With the payment hub complete to serve as the middleware in which to integrate external payments systems to both generations of Fineract and Mifos, Sidhant focused on integrating with the GSMA Mobile Money API &#8211; an open API standard that GSMA is establishing to harmonize mobile money APIs across the sector. Integrating with this reference mobile money API will provide the blueprint for partners and users to integrate with their local production mobile money APIs that they can gain access to both to synchronize in real-time mobile money transactions that are affecting accounts in Fineract and to initiate transactions via the mobile money network through Fineract or applications built on top of Fineract. Thank you to Sidhan’ts mentors &#8211; Avik Ganguly, Steve Conrad, Rahul Goel, and Sanyam Goel, as well as Phil Green for his responsiveness and support for the API. Sidhant completed integration with the merchant payment and peer to peer transfer use cases for Version 1.0 of the GSMA MM API with the payment hub. Since the payment hub is built on Camel, he created new camel routes to support these use cases. He also built out a simple web UI to demonstrate these transactions via the GSMA MM API simulator. Next on the roadmap is to incorporate additional use cases such as bulk transactions and bill payments/requests to pay as these APIs get supported in the simulator.</p>

Thank you to Aleksandar Vidakovic, Raul Sibaja, and Ramit Sawhney for the support they provided as mentors.  Anshul extended the 6-module architecture originally created by Dingfan by adding a seventh module, database, for storing user information and the necessary database related methods and templates to authenticate users. For the NLP module, per suggestions of his mentors, Anshul replaced Apache open-NLP with the rasa framework. Anshul focused extensively on the protocol module where he defined and tested new points of integration with Slack, Facebook Messenger, and Telegram.</span></p>

<h3><b>Machine Learning-Based Credit Scorecards for Loan Assessment Phase 2 &#8211; Supreeth Menon</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-10.03.28-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-7436 alignleft" src="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-10.03.28-PM.png" alt="" width="216" height="228" /></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supreeth resumed the work that his mentor, Lalit Mohan, had kicked off during the 2018 GSOC around building a machine-learning based scorecard for credit risk assessment. Supreeth focused on developing the user interface and database and API layer for the the feature screen of the scorecard, the configuration of the scorecard, the criteria screen and the scorecard screen itself. The feature screen supports definition of new features based value type &#8211; binary, nominal, etc, data type, and category. The configuration screen is used for mapping loan products to the color-coded scores for the loan &#8211; green indicates a loan can be given, amber indicates it needs further review and red indicates the loan is rejected. The criteria screen is used to obtain the key values for the feature  to perform the score &#8211; the features can be extracted from the DB schema or from an API (XML or JSON). The scorecard screen is used to profile a loan based on the rules recognized in previous screens, statistical methods, or machine learning methods. Supreeth is nearing full completion of the project but still has to implement the back-end for the scorecard screen and do SQL/API validation. On the roadmap are the statistical models and machine learning models to be incorporated.

<h2>Apache Fineract Interns</h2>
<p>Mifos took under its wing the GSOC interns accepted under the umbrella of Apache Software Foundation working on both Fineract and Fineract CN.</p>
<h3><b>Remove Category X Dependencies from Fineract CN &#8211; Ebenezer Graham (Apache)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-12-at-7.59.58-AM.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6918" src="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-12-at-7.59.58-AM.png" alt="" width="206" height="234" /></a>Ebenezer completed his second term as a Google Summer of Code intern for Apache working on removing Category X dependencies for Fineract CN as well as continuing to contribute to the notifications microservice he had built last summer. He worked with Isaac Kamga as his mentor. While he waited to get the scope of his core project finalized, Ebenezer enhanced the notifications microservice by containerizing it, adding email templating and removing dedicating user and adding tests for API endpoints. He also helped with the continuous integration infrastructure for the project by adding an after failure procedure for all builds in Fineract. For his core project, Ebenezer, had to work on the migration from MariaDB/MySQL to PostgreSQL and replacing Hibernate as the ORM. On the database front, Ebenezer did the final polishing to complete the work that Isaac had led on the migration of the database, testing all of the new configurations. To replace the ORM, Ebenezer first provided a thorough analysis of why EclipseLink was a much better alternative to OpenJPA as Apache-compliant ORM to replace Hibernate. After leading a thorough discussion with the community on the mailing list, the decision was clear and Ebenezer took up the work to complete migration of the ORM to EclipseLink. Ebenezer looks forward to continue to actively contribute to Fineract CN including the upgrading the key dependencies of the project like Sprint Boot. Read over Ebenezer’s gist for links to his code and to learn more. </span></p>
<h3><b>Update Swagger APIs &#8211; Kang Breder (Apache)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-10.03.43-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-7437 alignleft" src="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-10.03.43-PM.png" alt="" width="227" height="235" srcset="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-10.03.43-PM.png 282w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-10.03.43-PM-36x36.png 36w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /></a>Kang was the second Apache intern that worked alongside the Mifos GSOC interns this summer. With Sanyam as her mentor, she sought to bring to full production the conversion of the Fineract APIs to Swagger/OpenAPI format that Sanyam had led and Chirag had contributed to as well. The focus of her project consisted of completing Swagger documentation of the remaining APIs, incorporating the description of each API into the Swagger docs, including the Try It Out button for our Swagger APIs, automatic generation of Swagger Docs from the Fineract Build, navigation bar for the Swagger UI, migrating the overview section from our static API docs, completing a Swagger guide on how to add a new Swagger doc to any Fineract API and lastly QA. Kang was able to achieve nearly half of these goals and is continuing to wrap up the remaining milestones in the project. Kang has converted the remaining APIs that were added since Sanyam’s project that needed to be documented in Swagger format including the search APi, new self-service APIs, the pocket API and Audts API just to name a few. Kang included the description of each section of APIs so the Swagger Docs now has the same level of description that the static API docs did.  Kang spent significant time determining how to add the header params on all endpoints using swagger-annotations to enable the Try It Out button to work. Once Kang resolves in issue with the Swagger UI javascript, this feature will be complete. Kang is midway through completing usage of the swagger-gradle-plugin to save JSON during the build process and could use help from the community to help her resolve her exceptions. QA is nearly complete and the remaining milestones are still in progress with Kang aiming to complete them post-GSOC.

With the Apache Fineract dev list providing the main point of mailing list communication for our communities, Discourse would provide a valuable way to broaden the functional, technical and general fintech discussion and support processes that occur in the Mifos community. It’s forum interface with the ability to subscribe to posts allows us to have both the benefits of mailing-list style communications but the ease of navigation and searchability of a forum. The gamification components will also help to create a culture of supporting others throughout the community. Kerlyn has completed the setup and configuration of Discourse on a Mifos-hosted Azure instance to our community specifications and is wrapping up migration of the historical content and user databases of our Mifos mailing lists to Discourse. Stay tuned as we’ll have the test version of the site available and will begin the migration process over with the community.</span></p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Wikipedia and the Wikimedia projects form the largest collaborative collection of free knowledge &#8211; written in roughly 300 languages, and built by and for the world. At the Wikimedia Foundation, the U.S.-based nonprofit organization that operates Wikipedia, we strive to reflect the communities we currently work with, and those we hope to work with in the future. With this in mind, diversity and inclusion are core to our mission. In order to build a diverse and inclusive environment, we prioritize impact rather than intention, contributions rather than culture fit, and equity rather than equality.</p>
<p>To help us understand our progress, we’re releasing our 2019 U.S. staff diversity data, as well as information about the gender diversity of professionals we work with outside of the United States. When we shared the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2018/08/30/diversity-inclusion-numbers/">Foundation’s workforce diversity data in August 2018 for the first time</a>, we set a goal to focus our programs and initiatives on three values: consistency, transparency, and objectivity. We sought to do this in all parts of the employee lifecycle, including recruitment, onboarding, development, compensation, and promotions. We considered these three values to be a guiding light for the last fiscal year, which ran from July 2018 to June 2019.</p>
<p>With this annual report, our goal is to be transparent in our hiring and staffing efforts, objective in reflecting on our current and future initiatives, and consistent in our communication to our staff and broader community of people we work with about our efforts in diversity and inclusion.</p>
<h3>Diversity data for U.S. staff<sup>[1]</sup></h3>
<p>The Wikimedia Foundation has grown significantly in the last fiscal year. In analyzing the data from fiscal year 2018–19 and comparing it to the data from the previous fiscal year, it’s clear that we are making strides in our hiring practices, but it’s also clear that we have more work to do.</p>
<p>Over the course of the 2018–19 fiscal year, 53% of new hires in the U.S. were women and 30% of new hires were Black/African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, or Native American. Overall, our representation of women in the U.S. increased from 45% to 47%. Moreover, 41% of new hires in the U.S. for technical roles within the Foundation were women, 18% of which were women of color. We continue to have a higher representation of women than men in management and leadership roles, which is unique in comparison with other major technology organizations but is fairly consistent with nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>While these numbers are representative of consistent progress, we also take note of the work that is ahead of us. The latest data shows that overall only 13% of Foundation employees in the United States are Asian, 8% are Hispanic/Latino, 7% are Black/African-American, 0.4% are Native American/Alaskan Natives, and 5% are multi-racial. Overall, these numbers show an increase in people of color based in the United States as compared to <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2018/08/30/diversity-inclusion-numbers/">last year’s diversity report</a>, but we still have significant room to improve.</p>

<p>While the Wikimedia Foundation is headquartered in the U.S., our mission is global. As we continue to expand the number of people we work with based outside of the U.S., it is important that we continue to measure our progress in diversity in Wikimedia professionals globally.</p>
<p>The graph below covers our last four fiscal years, and illustrates a steady increase in the representation of women worldwide. These advancing numbers are an encouraging sign of progress, but there is still much work to be done in bringing more women into the organization and supporting their advancement. We’re unable to share global race and ethnicity information as collecting such information is not permitted in many countries.</p>

<h2>Advancing an inclusive culture</h2>
<p>Within the Foundation, we value seeking out the voices that are not currently represented, inviting differing perspectives, and celebrating what makes each of us unique. We’ve undertaken several efforts to advance a culture of inclusion and understand how we can continue to improve:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the 2018–19 fiscal year, we achieved a key goal of revitalizing our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_resource_group">employee resource groups</a> (ERGs), with five active groups and counting. These spaces provide employees with leadership opportunities, time to connect with their peers, and a space to build community, both internally and externally. In the coming year, we will be sharing guidelines on how to create ERGs that we hope will inspire staff to create even more spaces for community and connection.</li>
<li>We also kicked off our internal Diversity &amp; Inclusion Speaker Series. This program holds space for our staff to connect with experts and collaborators in various areas of diversity and inclusion work, whether it be in the workplace, academia, or through lived experience. The program has become a space for honest and raw conversations about social justice, equity, and belonging and we look forward to continuing with more opportunities for learning and connection.</li>
<li>Finally, we began working with <a href="https://www.paradigmiq.com/">Paradigm</a>, a diversity and inclusion strategy firm. They conducted a full assessment of our employee lifecycle by analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data, facilitating focus groups, evaluating our policies, and collaborating with us to create recommendations that will work for our environment. We are confident that their recommendations will enhance our culture of inclusion and enable us to more effectively embed diversity and inclusion throughout our processes and policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The strategy as we move forward</h2>
<p>The Wikimedia Foundation has grown in recent years in order to better support the growing free knowledge movement. In alignment with the direction of the Foundation and <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2018-20">a strategy that looks forward to the year 2030</a>, our focus internally is with service and equity. To carry this out, our diversity and inclusion strategy over the coming months includes: the implementation of the recommendations from <a href="https://www.paradigmiq.com/">Paradigm</a>, the creation of new partnerships with organizations that uphold models of equitable service to support shared learning, the continuation of our Diversity &amp; Inclusion Speaker Series, and bringing on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190930202139/https://boards.greenhouse.io/wikimedia/jobs/1775293">Global Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Director</a>. More broadly, we will be focusing on what equity and service means to us as an organization and how these themes can serve as a framework for our culture, including how we recruit new talent and make decisions across the organization.</p>
<p>While we still have work to do, our hope is that this report serves as an indication of where we are and where we’re going on this journey. When we began reporting our diversity and inclusion data last year, we recognized that this was just the beginning. We are always learning new terms, developing new techniques, and finding better ways to make our staff feel celebrated. Change doesn’t occur overnight, but we are dedicated to co-creating a thriving movement that incorporates diversity of thought, respect for all, and a framework where service, equity and liberation take the front seat.</p>

<h2>Footnote</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">[1] The diversity data for U.S. Foundation staff is from June 2019 and based on similar data that would be reported in the United States EEO-1 report and includes job category, gender, and race/ethnicity. When evaluating gender in this survey, the data is binary and does not accurately account for individuals who identify along a non-binary spectrum. The EEO-1 survey requires we provide information about Foundation employees based in the United States in each calendar year and does not reflect those we work with through third parties, whether based in the United States or in other countries. Categories are provided by the government, and self-reported by employees. It is important to note that United States law differs from that of many other countries in terms of personal information that must be reported, based in large part on the culture and history behind the laws that require seeking such information about U.S. employees. In contrast to the United States, many other countries prohibit obtaining or reporting information about race/ethnicity. We believe, however, that the United States data is still useful in helping us assess progress relating to overall organizational diversity.</p>

        <p>Earlier this year, we announced TensorFlow 2.0 in alpha at the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit">TensorFlow Dev Summit</a>. Today, we’re delighted to announce that the final release of TensorFlow 2.0 is now available! Learn how to install it <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install">here</a>.</p><p>TensorFlow 2.0 is driven by the community telling us they want an easy-to-use platform that is both flexible and powerful, and which supports deployment to any platform. TensorFlow 2.0 provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools for developers, enterprises, and researchers who want to push the state-of-the-art in machine learning and build scalable ML-powered applications.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FEqWsPO8DVXk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEqWsPO8DVXk&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FEqWsPO8DVXk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/669dccf5c26ce313693cde3b7bf0bbd8/href">https://medium.com/media/669dccf5c26ce313693cde3b7bf0bbd8/href</a></iframe><h4><strong>Coding with TensorFlow 2.0</strong></h4><p>TensorFlow 2.0 makes development of ML applications much easier. With tight integration of <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview">Keras into TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager">eager execution</a> by default, and Pythonic function execution, TensorFlow 2.0 makes the experience of developing applications as familiar as possible for Python developers. For researchers pushing the boundaries of ML, we have invested heavily in TensorFlow’s low-level API: We now export all ops that are used internally, and we provide inheritable interfaces for crucial concepts such as variables and checkpoints. This allows you to build onto the internals of TensorFlow without having to rebuild TensorFlow.</p><figure><img alt="Training and deployment diagram" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*C7GCWYlsMrhUYRYi" /></figure><p>To be able to run models on a variety of runtimes, including the cloud, web, browser, Node.js, mobile and embedded systems, we have standardized on the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model">SavedModel</a> file format. This allows you to run your models with TensorFlow, deploy them with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving">TensorFlow Serving</a>, use them on mobile and embedded systems with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite">TensorFlow Lite</a>, and train and run in the browser or Node.js with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">TensorFlow.js</a>.</p><p>For high-performance training scenarios, you can use the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training">Distribution Strategy API</a> to distribute training with minimal code changes and attain great out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras’ Model.fit and also supports custom training loops. <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu">Multi-GPU support</a> is now available, and you can learn more about using GPUs on Google Cloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/">here</a>. Cloud TPU support is coming in a future release. Check out the distributed training <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training">guide</a> for more details.</p><p>TensorFlow 2.0 offers many performance improvements on GPUs. TensorFlow 2.0 delivers up to 3x faster training performance using mixed precision on Volta and Turing GPUs with a few lines of code, used for example in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/resnet">ResNet-50</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp/bert">BERT</a>. TensorFlow 2.0 is tightly integrated with TensorRT and uses <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r2.0/tensorflow/python/compiler/tensorrt/trt_convert.py#L766-L859">an improved API</a> to deliver better usability and high performance during inference on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/ml-inference-t4">NVIDIA T4 Cloud GPUs</a> on Google Cloud.</p><p>“Machine learning on NVIDIA GPUs and systems allows developers to solve problems that seemed impossible just a few years ago,” said Kari Briski, Senior Director of Accelerated Computing Software Product Management at NVIDIA. “TensorFlow 2.0 is packed with many great GPU acceleration features, and we can’t wait to see the amazing AI applications the community will create with these updated tools.”</p><p>Effective access for training and validation data is paramount to being effective when building models in TensorFlow. We introduced <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data">TensorFlow Datasets</a>, giving a standard interface to a plethora of datasets containing a variety of data types such as images, text, video, and more.</p><p>While the traditional Session-based programming model is still maintained, we recommend using regular Python development with eager execution. The <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/performance">tf.function</a> decorator can be used to convert your code into graphs which can be executed remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance. This is complemented by <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function">Autograph</a>, which can convert regular Python control flow directly into TensorFlow control flow.</p><p>And of course, if you have used TensorFlow 1.x and are looking for a migration guide to 2.0, we have published one <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate">here</a>. The TensorFlow 2.0 release also includes an automatic conversion script to help get you started.</p><p>We have worked with many users inside Google and from the TensorFlow community to test TensorFlow 2.0 features and have been thrilled with the feedback. As an example, the Google News team launched a BERT-based language understanding model in TensorFlow 2.0 that <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/news/new-google-news-ai-meets-human-intelligence/">significantly improved story coverage</a>. TensorFlow 2.0 provides easy-to-use APIs with the flexibility to implement new ideas quickly. Model training and serving was seamlessly integrated into the existing infrastructure.</p><p>Also, ML isn’t just for Python developers — using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">TensorFlow.js,</a> training and inference is available to JavaScript developers, and we continue to invest in Swift as a language for building models with the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/swift">Swift for TensorFlow</a> library.</p><p>There’s a lot to unpack here, so to assist, we’ve created a handy guide on how to be <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/effective_tf2">effective with all that’s new in TensorFlow 2.0</a>. To make it even easier to get started with TensorFlow 2.0, we are releasing reference implementations of several commonly used ML models using the 2.0 API <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/models-datasets">here</a>.</p><p>Additionally, to learn how to build applications using TensorFlow 2.0, check out the online courses we have created together with <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow">deeplearning.ai</a> and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187">Udacity</a>.</p><p>To get started quickly try <a href="https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-vm/">Google Cloud’s Deep Learning VM Images</a> — no setup required, pre-configured virtual machines to help you build your TensorFlow 2.0 deep learning projects.</p><h4><strong>Learn More</strong></h4><p>Head over to <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">tensorflow.org</a> for more about TensorFlow 2.0, including how to download and get started with coding ML applications.

      <div class="content">
        <p>Assigning Wikipedia as a classroom assignment is a difficult proposition. The idea of integrating the encyclopedia into a curriculum has been stigmatized for many years, and it can be complicated to ensure that students&#8217; work fits into Wikipedia&#8217;s extensive policies and guidelines.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, however, a brave cadre of professors and teachers have been out to change that. And earlier this year, one of those educators contacted <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Israel">Wikimedia Israel</a> (WMIL), an independent affiliate, with the idea of bringing a Wikipedia assignment in their course.</p>
<p>The educator was Dr. Daniela Shabar-Shapira, from the Tel-Aviv University School of Social Work, and the course was <em>Women and Gender in Social Work—a Feminist Perspective</em>. The topic matter of the course gave us some pause, as established Wikipedia editors can view such courses as being agenda-driven, thereby violating Wikipedia&#8217;s founding principle of neutral point of view.</p>
<p>Never one to shy away from a challenge, WMIL’s academic coordinator met with Dr. Shabar-Shapira and Moran Abouloff-Pick, her teaching assistant, to learn more about the course&#8217;s characteristics and explore how a Wikipedia assignment could be integrated. The course they are teaching is part of a retraining program for a master’s degree in social work. Students in this program come from different academic backgrounds—mostly social studies or behavioral studies—and hold at least a bachelor’s degree. The three-year program also includes guided training in the field, i.e., the students work at an organization and learn the practical aspects of the trade.</p>
<p>This specific course focuses on the principles of treatment and intervention from a feminist perspective. It covers, among other things, topics related to the history and different waves of the feminist movement and theory, development and crystallization of feminine identity, psychological theories of women and gender, intersection of marginal positions, and more. The Wikipedia assignment was to write about a topic covered in the course and relating to their practical field work.</p>
<p>WMIL’s academic coordinator met with the students and gave an introduction to Wikipedia and its writing guidelines. One point of emphasis was that content about feminism need not appear under a heading of a “feminist perspective.” It suffices that those undercovered topics, aspects, or studies be added with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources">reliable</a> sources and described using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view">neutral</a> language.</p>
<p>To ensure that the topics written as assignments are suitable for Wikipedia, students had to submit their suggested topic and a list of sources (references) to WMIL’s academic coordinator. The coordinator reviewed the notability of the suggested topics and the reliability of the sources. In some cases the suggested topic was risky as an article on its own.</p>
<p>For example, the topic “insidious trauma” is a well-known term coined by psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_P._P._Root">Maria Root</a>. However, as there is no article about this topic in any other Wikipedia, the recommendation was to write about the topic within the scope of an article about Maria Root (which did not exist in Hebrew).</p>
<p>In other cases, WMIL’s coordinator identified existing articles which the suggested topics could expand on, or made recommendations on specific areas of focus. For example, a student planning to write about “homelessness among LGBT youth in Israel” eventually expanded the article about homelessness, adding information about homelessness among youth, in general, and also among LGBT youth.</p>
<p>The students’ work was checked for its content by the course instructors, and following their approval, it was uploaded as a draft (known as a &#8220;sandbox&#8221; in Wikipedia&#8217;s parlance). The academic coordinator then reviewed the drafts and corrected any content or style issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">• • •</p>
<p>This pilot project, though small in scale, was a resounding success. All eight articles or expansions were accepted without discussion. In total, 138,000 bytes were added. The instructors and the students reported enormous satisfaction from making their work accessible through Wikipedia, thereby making important information that was lacking, freely available to the public. Moreover, they viewed the assignment as a particularly fitting task that, like the profession they are learning, combines the academic with the practical.</p>
<p>WMIL’s conclusion from this pilot is that it is possible to write about sensitive or potentially controversial issues in the framework of an academic Wikipedia assignment, providing that the process is structured, guided and supervised well. More specific insights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instructors and students must be acquainted with Wikipedia&#8217;s neutral point of view and reliable sources policies.</li>
<li>The topics for the assignment must be curated by an experienced Wikimedia editor</li>
<li>Having at least one teaching assistant, depending on the size of the course, is crucial for the coordination and supervision of the assignment. Given the workload of most university lecturers, it is unlikely that a university lecturer would be able to give students the required support to complete such a task.</li>
<li>It is imperative to create clear instructions and guidelines for the students. These describe the assignment and what is expected of them, provide clarity about the process milestones, and lay down the deadlines for each phase.</li>
<li>To minimize conflicts with other Wikipedia editors, it is advisable that students do not edit directly in the article space, but rather in the sandbox. Moving the content to the article space should only be done after it has been reviewed by a Wikimedia editor.</li>
</ul>

        <p><em>A Guest Post by Rodolfo Bonnin from the Mercado Libre Applied Machine Learning team</em></p><figure><img alt="Mercado libre banner" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*K5llZP4xxf_GmvZF" /></figure><h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4><p><a href="https://www.mercadolibre.com/">Mercado Libre</a> is the leading marketplace platform in Latin America, reaching millions of users selling and buying tens of millions of different items a day. From a shipping perspective, one of the most important pieces of information for an item is dimensions and weight since they are used for predicting costs and forecasting the occupancy of the fulfillment centers. As a user-driven marketplace, this information is not always available, and we have found that we can optimize our pipeline by predicting it in advance.</p><figure><img alt="Initial listing submission screen" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*1xHTR47-aUL8AzjS" /><figcaption><em>Our initial listing submission screen does not ask for measurements or weight</em></figcaption></figure><p>Mercado Libre is a general marketplace, so an item could be either a new cellphone (between 7 - 14 ounces, and approximately 5″ x 5″ x 2″), or a used dishwasher weighing 175 pounds and measuring 24″ x 24″ x 35″.</p><p>Initially, we implemented a lookup mechanism, which consisted of determining measure and weight based on previous measurements of the item in our fulfillment, cross-docking, and validating third party carriers, and after an outlier filtering process. Of course, this process had low coverage (the percentage of items already measured was low).</p><p>As a second measure, we built simple models based on statistical summaries of single product features, like category and brand/model, and used product similarity metrics to map new items to existing ones. These methods had poor accuracy in general, and there were a large number of cases where no prediction was possible because there weren’t adequate samples.</p><p>The need arose for a regression model, able to infer measurements from information like the item title, description, category, and a few other attributes. Importantly, these attributes include both structured and unstructured data, which are difficult to model with traditional statistical methods. The model predicts and saves 3k predictions a minute (4M a day), and the API serves (mostly pre-saved) 200k requests a minute (288M a day).</p><h4><strong>Data and features</strong></h4><p>When preparing the next iteration, after reviewing the listing publication process, we had the certainty that at least the listing title, item description (free text), along with the category and the product brand were likely to be key features for the model. Of course, the data had to be cleaned up and prepared to be useful for our project. The software stack for the ETL part of the project, was based on scipy, pandas, numpy and scikit-learn. Once we had decided on features, it was time to vectorize the data.</p><figure><img alt="Composition of the model’s feature union" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/811/0*AB4xb8BV4Cs4fsoX" /><figcaption><em>Composition of the model’s feature union</em></figcaption></figure><p>To encode the two main text based features, we tokenized and lower cased all the words. Next, we needed to find a suitable vector representation. For this first iteration of this project, we decided to experiment with a method using keywords and TF-idf, rather than an LSTM which we will explore in the future. TF-idf is a vectorization technique, applied to text data, which converts tokenized documents into a matrix.</p><h4><strong>The Model</strong></h4><p>The model we used was a Multi-Layer Perceptron, implemented in keras with the Tensorflow backend. Hyperparameters and architecture details were chosen by performing a grid search on learning rate, dropout, number of layers, number of kernels and kernel dimensions (we now know that random search is a much better approach).</p><p>Regarding the loss function, we tried several experiments to see which one was more appropriate:</p><p>The <strong>mean_squared_error</strong> provided a measure that, even when heavily penalizing the errors, overshot to fit outliers. The <strong>mean_absolute_percentage_error</strong> preserved especially the smaller items zone from outliers (with the lower 1Kg covering 50% of the items). The <strong>mean_absolute_error</strong> was useful for general and broad optimization, across all item classes.</p><figure><img alt="Weight error distribution for the different types of loss function" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*fmR6yNOnsIhSkUIL" /><figcaption><em>Weight error distribution for the different types of loss function</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="The model" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ftsbXZfZSXKyDyr_" /><figcaption>General architecture of the neural network model</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Serving predictions</strong></h4><p>The model is currently being used in the product submission page and the fulfillment center packaging calculator, to forecast the occupancy of the shelves and the right envelope to use at the final product packaging stage.</p><p>The API currently serves 3k predictions a minute or 4M a day. The inference time for our model is 30ms and we serve it on a 64GB RAM + 6 cores instance with 13 ~900MB workers.</p><p>Here is an example Json response:</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/9cf5bc56d31bb2bd025591d04654423a/href">https://medium.com/media/9cf5bc56d31bb2bd025591d04654423a/href</a></iframe><p>Moving forward, we plan to run additional experiments to optimize model quality and to refine the results based on feedback from the fulfillment center.

        <p><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thor:_Ragnarok#Dialogue">Much like Asgard</a>, Wikipedia is not a place but a people. Specifically, an extensive community of volunteers from around the world who donate their time each day to building, curating, and watching over the largest collection of knowledge ever assembled.</p>
<p>Unlike Asgard, the people who contribute to Wikipedia often only rarely meet outside of the internet, and so we here at the Wikimedia Foundation set out in 2013 to make it easier for users to &#8220;<a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Thanks">thank</a>&#8221; each other for taking actions on the site.</p>
<p>Fast forward six years, and the feature is still live on all Wikimedia projects; two clicks are all that is required to thank a user for making any particular change. Assuming that you&#8217;ve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F">created and logged into a Wikimedia account</a>, you can see the &#8220;thanks&#8221; option on the &#8220;history&#8221; tab accessible from any Wikimedia page.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the Wikimedia Foundation&#8217;s <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/research/">Research team</a>, in collaboration with researchers from Gunn High School and the University of Toronto, set out to determine how effective the thanks feature has been.</p>
<p>We posed a variety of questions as part of this study:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often is the thanks feature used in Wikimedia projects?</li>
<li>Are there projects in which the thanks feature is used more often?</li>
<li>Are there specific groups of editors who use the thanks feature more (or less) than others?</li>
<li>What is the impact of thanking an editor’s revision?</li>
</ul>

Here&#8217;s what we learned:</p>

<li>In the largest languages, thanks are typically sent upwards (from less experienced to more experienced editors). However,  the most experienced editors send/receive thanks less frequently relative to their total edit count as compared to all other editor groups.</li>
<li>Some projects break from trends of “thanks” usage seen in the other studied languages. Thanks on the Norwegian Wikipedia, for instance, are typically sent downwards, not upwards. Additionally, a greater percentage of editors on that Wikipedia have interacted with the thanks feature than the overall average of 5%.</li>
<li>A controlled test indicates that receiving a single thank can increase a person’s edit count by a factor of &gt;1.5 over the next day. This increased editing effect fades within the next month, but it is still strong for the next week following a thank.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Finally, here&#8217;s some possible directions for future studies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding this study to include smaller languages and further examining how “thanks” usage differs across projects.</li>
<li>Examining whether the impact of receiving thanks is cumulative. It appears that receiving a thank has a strong short-term effect. Does receiving multiple thanks have a longer term effect?</li>
<li>Advocating increased usage of the Thanks feature! If it can increase engagement and foster positive interaction between editors, it should be taken full advantage of!</li>
</ul>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Today, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Justice_of_the_European_Union">Court of Justice of the European Union</a> (CJEU) has issued a landmark privacy ruling regarding Europeans’ right to request search engines delist search results about themselves. We are excited that the court has considered the effect of such delistings on other fundamental rights like freedom of expression in its decision, but concerned about the increasing reliance of both companies and now courts on geographical barriers to limit access to information on the internet. Before we address the court’s decision, however, let’s start with some background.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the protection of privacy online has been a focus of European regulators, and Europe has seen a number of laws passed in an effort to protect citizens’ privacy. Often, these laws will lay out a principle or right, but the exact contours of that right end up being determined later by courts. The CJEU has just issued one such clarifying decision about a process called “delisting” or “de-referencing.” Delisting, sometimes referred to as the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">right to be forgotten</a>,” is a process through which a person can request that information about themselves be removed from search engine results returned for that person’s name. But how far does this right to delist extend?</p>
<p>This is the exact question tackled by the CJEU in <em>Google v. CNIL</em>. After delisting was recognized as a right in Europe, Google put in place processes for European citizens to request certain information about them that was available online be delisted. Through this process, Google would ensure that these results were delisted in its European domains such as Google.fr or Google.de, but did not apply the delisting outside of Europe. This meant that if you were searching from the United States, using Google.com, these results would still be available.</p>
<p>However, in 2015, the French data protection authority (“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_nationale_de_l%27informatique_et_des_libert%C3%A9s">CNIL</a>”) informed Google that delisting requests must be honored worldwide, not just in the European Union. When Google proposed an alternative solution, the CNIL appealed to France’s highest court, where the Wikimedia Foundation intervened to offer our perspective on delisting and access to knowledge. The court sent questions regarding the scope of delisting to the CJEU, and the Wikimedia Foundation again submitted observations on the matter. Now, almost a year after the arguments before the CJEU, the court has found that search engines are not required under EU law to carry out delisting requests across all versions of the search engine, only those which correspond with EU Member states. While not closing off the possibility of global delistings in certain circumstances, the court has essentially approved Google’s current processes for delisting, which uses a process called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-blocking">geoblocking</a>” to identify where a user is searching from based on their IP address.</p>
<p>We applaud this recognition that delisting should not extend beyond EU borders to the rest of the globe. In the Wikimedia Foundation’s brief to the court, we expressed our concern that the practice of delisting search results could harm both free expression and access to knowledge online. We are happy to see this argument acknowledged in the CJEU’s decision, which says, “The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality.”</p>
<p>Despite this, there are still some troubling aspects of this decision. Primarily, we remain concerned about the inequality in access to knowledge that results from any form of delisting orders. Wikipedia is founded on a premise of providing access to knowledge for all and Wikipedias are differentiated by language, not geography. What the CJEU’s decision means is that if someone requests the delisting of an article on Spanish Wikipedia, users in Mexico will still see this page in their search results, but users in Spain will not. Because these delisting decisions are often targeted toward only a small portion of the information contained on a page, this means that entire communities will lose the ability to easily search for information solely because of where they are located.</p>
<p>This highlights a larger trend of internet fragmentation, a growing concern for the interconnected global community that is the Wikimedia movement. As individual countries demonstrate an increased desire to regulate the internet, often in contradictory ways, this can lead to the internet looking very different depending on where you are located.  Although the Wikimedia communities generally strive to be respectful of national laws, this will become increasingly difficult to navigate as countries place more granular requirements on online content. Volunteers come to Wikipedia to share their knowledge and learn from others, no matter where they are located.</p>
<p>Geoblocking, as envisioned here, is far superior to global delisting, which would essentially make it impossible to find certain information through a search engine. However, the type of geographical fragmentation it envisions will present challenges for movements that cross borders.</p>
<p>In the end, the internet is a global resource that connects people across the world every day to share their perspectives, creations, and knowledge. Let&#8217;s try to keep it that way.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>In science fiction, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Galactica"><em>Encyclopedia Galactica</em></a> is a compendium of a galaxy&#8217;s worth of knowledge.</p>
<p>Wikipedia isn&#8217;t quite there yet—for one, we&#8217;ve barely left Earth. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean we aren&#8217;t trying to put together a planet&#8217;s worth of knowledge and ensure that all of its inhabitants can learn from it in their own languages.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where our content translation tool comes in. The tool simplifies translating Wikipedia articles into different languages by automating many of the tedious steps inherent in manually translating Wikipedia&#8217;s articles. As of last month, more than half a million articles have been created with the help of the content translation tool since its introduction.</p>
<p>Why did we build this tool? It&#8217;s simple: translating Wikipedia&#8217;s knowledge into new languages can help reduce our knowledge gap. For example, English-speaking users can access more than five million articles. Bengali speakers, a language of 260 million people, have access to a mere 75,000.</p>
<p>The content translation tool has not been easy to construct, maintain, and grow. We&#8217;ve spent four years constructing and fine-tuning it to best fit Wikipedia&#8217;s decentralized model, ensuring that it fits into all of Wikimedia&#8217;s many individual wikis which have grown and developed their own custom infrastructure to suit their local contexts.</p>
<p>More recently, the Wikimedia Foundation has worked to modernize the content translation tool with a rich-text interface and improve its output by utilizing artificial intelligence. The tool now provides users with an initial machine translation for them to improve prior to publishing, and incorporates safeguards which help ensure that all untouched machine translations are reviewed. We&#8217;ve <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2019/01/09/you-can-now-use-google-translate-to-translate-articles-on-wikipedia/">partnered with Google</a> to ensure that these automatically translated items are as high-quality as possible, and we&#8217;ve ensured that none of our users&#8217; data is being passed to Google in the process.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re liking what we&#8217;re seeing from the newly improved content translation tool. In the last year, it has been used to translate nearly 150,000 articles, an over twenty percent increase in the year-over-year number. Moreover, our data shows that translated articles are less likely to be deleted than articles created from scratch.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s next for the tool? As part of the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Medium-term_plan_2019">Wikimedia Foundation&#8217;s medium-term plan</a>, released earlier this year, the Foundation&#8217;s language team will be focusing on <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Content_translation/Boost">two key areas</a>: ensuring that the full suite of translation tools can be used by as many different language Wikimedia wikis as possible, and in expanding the kinds of contributions that the content translation tool supports. They&#8217;ll take on the former before tackling the latter, starting with the Malayalam, Bengali, Tagalog, Javanese, and Mongolian languages.</p>

TFX was created by Google and provides the backbone of Google’s ML services and applications, and we’ve been open sourcing TFX for everyone who needs to create production ML pipelines.</p><figure><img alt="TFX pipeline" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/948/0*5_LeOofdfAR6IX09" /></figure><p>TFX can be extended and customized in several ways, including developing new components and including them in your pipeline. A TFX pipeline is a series of TFX components, each of which performs a separate task, which are sequenced as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this post we’ll present an example to illustrate the process of developing a new <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide#anatomy_of_a_component">TFX component</a>. Watch for more posts that will discuss additional ways to extend and customize TFX.</p><h3>Scenario</h3><p>We want to replace the behavior of the existing <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/trainer">TFX Trainer component</a> with a new component that includes an <em>executor</em> which submits a job to run the same training on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</a>. Since the upstream and downstream semantics will remain unchanged, we will reuse the existing Trainer component and replace the behavior of the executor.</p><h3>Anatomy of a Component</h3><figure><img alt="Anatomy of a component" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*9fwUFzc4OSaVgpQuJm8F9g.png" /></figure><p>TFX components consist of three main pieces:</p><ul><li>Driver</li><li>Executor</li><li>Publisher</li></ul><h4>Driver and Publisher</h4><p>The driver supplies metadata to the executor by querying the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/mlmd">ML Metadata (MLMD)</a> store and the publisher takes the results of the executor and updates the metadata store. As a developer, you will typically not need to interact with the driver and publisher directly, but messages logged by the driver and publisher may be <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide#troubleshooting">useful during debugging</a>.</p><h4>Executor</h4><p>The executor is where a component performs its processing. As a developer you write code which runs in the executor, based on the requirements of the classes which implement the type of component that you’re working with. For example, when you’re working on a Transform component you will need to develop a preprocessing_fn. Executors consume and create artifacts, which are kept in the metadata store.</p><h3>Adding a custom executor</h3><h4>Creating a custom executor</h4><p>To create the custom executor, we start with a copy of the current Trainer <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/components/trainer/executor.py">executor</a> and then make the modifications to our <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/extensions/google_cloud_ai_platform/trainer/executor.py">custom executor</a> to initiate a training job on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/">Google Cloud AI Platform</a>. Much of the basic executor structure will remain the same as the inputs, outputs, and execution parameters will be the same. The changes will be in how the inputs are processed and the outputs are generated. This is achieved by creating a new Executor class that extends<em> tfx.components.base.base_executor.BaseExecutor</em> and implements <em>Do()</em>.</p><pre>class Executor(base_executor.BaseExecutor):<br>  &quot;&quot;&quot;Start a trainer job on Google Cloud AI Platform.&quot;&quot;&quot;<br><br>  def Do(self, input_dict,<br>         output_dict,<br>         exec_properties):<br>    &quot;&quot;&quot;Starts a trainer job on Google Cloud AI Platform.</pre><p>Don’t forget to test it before moving on to the next step! We have created a convenience <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/scripts/run_executor.py">script</a> for you to try out your executor before putting it into production. You should write similar code to exercise unit tests for your code. As with any production software deployment, when developing for TFX you should make sure to have good test coverage and a strong CI/CD framework.</p><h4>Override the executor used by the Trainer component</h4><p>In order to do this, we will replace the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/components/trainer/executor.py">default trainer executor </a>used by TFX with the new <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/extensions/google_cloud_ai_platform/trainer/executor.py">custom executor</a> which will create the training job on Google Cloud AI Platform. This is achieved with the optional <em>executor_class </em>component parameter.</p><pre>from tfx.extensions.google_cloud_ai_platform.trainer<br>import executor as ai_platform_trainer_executor<br>...<br>trainer = Trainer(<br>    ...,<br>    executor_class=ai_platform_trainer_executor.Executor,<br>}</pre><p>That’s it! Now when the Trainer component is called by the workflow engine, it will run the custom executor instead of the default executor, while creating and consuming the same <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/mlmd">ML Metadata</a> artifacts as the default executor.</p><h4>Pass the component arguments to your trainer</h4><p>TFX executors are self-contained binaries focused on running a single step of the ML pipeline. Custom executors require the same three parameters as all other TFX executors: <em>input_dict, output_dict, exec_properties</em>. More details on the semantics of these parameters can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/components/base/base_executor.py#L32"><em>BaseExecutor</em></a> class.</p><p>When processing data flowing through your TFX pipeline you will often typically want to read input data from the artifact URIs in your <em>input_dict</em>, and often you might want to write your output to artifact URIs from your <em>output_dict</em>. This may include reading and writing to more than one split, as in the case of processing with train and eval splits.</p><pre>from tfx.types import artifact_utils<br><br>train_input_examples_uri = artifact_utils.get_split_uri(<br>  input_dict[&#39;my_input_data&#39;], &#39;train&#39;)<br>eval_input_examples_uri = artifact_utils.get_split_uri(<br>  input_dict[&#39;my_input_data&#39;], &#39;eval&#39;)<br><br>train_output_examples_uri = artifact_utils.get_split_uri(<br>  output_dict[&#39;my_output_data&#39;], &#39;train&#39;)<br>eval_output_examples_uri = artifact_utils.get_split_uri(<br>  output_dict[‘my_output_data&#39;], &#39;eval&#39;)</pre><p>In the example above the dictionary keys <em>my_input_data </em>and <em>my_output_data </em>are defined in the ComponentSpec for the component that you’re overriding the executor for.</p><pre>class MyComponentSpec(tfx.types.ComponentSpec):<br>  PARAMETERS = {<br>      &lt;...&gt;<br>  }<br>  INPUTS = {<br>      &#39;my_input_data&#39;:   <br>      ChannelParameter(type=standard_artifacts.Examples),<br>  }<br>  OUTPUTS = {<br>      &#39;my_output_data&#39;:<br>      ChannelParameter(type=standard_artifacts.Examples),                                                            <br>  }</pre><p>The splits are defined in the output Channel for the component that you’re overriding the executor for, typically in the constructor:</p><pre>output_data = tfx.types.Channel(<br>  type=standard_artifacts.Examples,<br>    artifacts=[<br>      standard_artifacts.Examples(split=split)<br>      for split in artifact.DEFAULT_EXAMPLE_SPLITS<br>    ])<br>spec = LabelingComponentSpec(<br>  input_data=input_data,<br>  my_output_data=output_data)</pre><p>Additional parameters are passed to your custom trainer executor using a <em>custom_config dict</em>. These can be retrieved by the custom executor using <em>exec_properties.get(‘custom_config’).get(‘your_config_key’).</em> In the example below, all of the additional arguments needed to submit a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/training-overview">Google Cloud AI Platform training job </a>can be found in <em>_ai_platform_training_args</em>.</p><pre>_ai_platform_training_args = {<br>   &#39;pythonModule&#39;: None,  # Will be populated by TFX<br>   &#39;args&#39;: None,  # Will be populated by TFX<br>   &#39;region&#39;: _gcp_region,<br>   &#39;jobDir&#39;: os.path.join(_output_bucket, &#39;tmp&#39;),<br>   &#39;project&#39;: ‘your GCP project id’<br>}<br><br>...<br>trainer = Trainer(<br>    ...,<br>    custom_config={&#39;ai_platform_training_args&#39;:<br>    _ai_platform_training_args})   <br>}</pre><h4>Linking the custom trainer’s output to the expected output artifact</h4><p>Hooking up the custom trainer to emit the expected outputs is essential to the success of downstream components. For the Google Cloud AI Platform custom trainer, we serialize the executor input parameters so they can be transmitted as part of the GCP training job. Because the Google Cloud AI Platform (CAIP) executor is redirecting the default TFX executor to run on Google Cloud AI Platform, both take the same {<em>transformed examples, a transform_fn, </em>and a<em> schema</em>} input parameters to create a TF model. The custom executor used in this example submits a CAIP training job that will invoke (via <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/scripts/run_executor.py">run_executor.py</a>) the default TFX trainer as the CAIP python module, effectively opening a conduit from the local workstation to run the TFX trainer on CAIP.</p><pre># Configure Google Cloud AI Platform job<br>    training_inputs = exec_properties.get(&#39;custom_config&#39;,<br>        {}).pop(&#39;ai_platform_training_args&#39;)<br>    executor_class_path = &#39;%s.%s&#39; % <br>        (tfx_trainer_executor.Executor.__module__,<br>        tfx_trainer_executor.Executor.__name__)<br><br>    # Start Google Cloud AI Platform job<br>    return runner.start_cmle_training(input_dict, output_dict,<br>        exec_properties, executor_class_path, training_inputs)</pre><h3>Running the pipeline remotely with your custom executor</h3><p>So far we’ve been assuming that your pipeline is running locally, using code available in your $PYTHONPATH. An upcoming blog post will explain how to execute custom executors packaged in containers, or as PyPI packages.</p><h3>Related topics</h3><p>In addition to Trainer, the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/examplegen.md#custom-examplegen">TFX ExampleGen component</a> also supports executor-level customization. ExampleGen provides a generic component and a base executor which apply ML best practices, e.g. data shuffling and consistent/configurable partitions.</p><p>If existing ExampleGen components don’t meet your needs, create a new <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a> PTransform for handling the conversion from an input split to TF examples and TFX will do the rest.

        <p><em>Guest post by Keith Chan and Vincent Zhang from OliveX Engineering team</em></p><h3>Introduction</h3><p><a href="https://www.olivex.ai/">OliveX</a> is a Hong Kong-based company focused on fitness-related software, serving more than 2 million users since we first launched in 2018. Many of our users are elderly and our Baduanjin app helps them practice Baduanjin while minimizing the possibility of injury. To achieve that, we utilize the latest artificial intelligence technology in our app to automatically detect Baduanjin practicing moves and provide corresponding feedback to our users.</p><h3>Goals and requirements</h3><p>Baduanjin is a popular exercise that consists of eight kinds of limb movements and controlled breathing. Precise movements and control are critical for Baduanjin, which improves the health of the body both mentally and physically.</p><figure><img alt="Animated person performing body movements" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*2LvOTf1WNQ7J0Y33" /></figure><p>By using the “Smart Baduanjin” app, users can determine if they are performing the moves correctly by using AI to track their movements. By leveraging the latest machine learning technology, we hope to replace the traditional learning approach in which users simply follow an exercise video with a more enjoyable interactive experience in which users get feedback on their body movements in real time. We also hope that these features could help the elderly to practice Baduanjin more effectively and reduce the risk of injury.</p><figure><img alt="Stills from the ‘Smart Baduanjin’ app" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Us5wKti-jB4ZrcIAQHf2wg.png" /></figure><p>After analyzing and prioritizing our goals, we defined the overall product requirements:</p><ol><li>Our uses usually perform Baduanjin in an outdoor setting, so our product needs to be ‘mobile’</li><li>When a user practices Baduanjin, he/she usually needs to follow a demo video and imitate the movements from a coach, so our product should be able to play videos with sound</li><li>To provide valuable real time feedback to our users, we need to capture user body movements with the front-facing camera</li></ol><p>Specifically regarding the body movement recognition, we want our algorithms to be able to do the following:</p><ol><li>Recognize each Baduanjin movement in the overall sequence</li><li>Give scores based on the correctness of a user’s body movements</li><li>Provide correctional guidance on unsatisfactory movements</li></ol><h3>Technical analysis</h3><h4>ML framework selection</h4><p>Based on the requirements above, we needed to select the right deep learning framework to implement our project. In particular, we were looking for a framework that has:</p><ol><li>Strong support for mobile devices and can run smoothly, even on mid- to low-end smartphones</li><li>A friendly API design and rich debugging tools</li><li>Mature community support and resources available</li></ol><p>After comprehensive investigation and evaluation, we found that TensorFlow Lite satisfied our needs and requirements. In addition, Google open sourced <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet">PoseNet</a>, an app specifically designed for detecting human body poses, and provided demo code based on TensorFlow.js (EDITOR: we have recently released a <a href="https://medium.com/tensorflow/track-human-poses-in-real-time-on-android-with-tensorflow-lite-e66d0f3e6f9e">PoseNet sample based on TensorFlow Lite</a>). Google not only helped us finish the initial work for human body pose recognition with the help of the open source code, but also convinced us that our action recognition algorithm could work on mobile devices, since the performance on JavaScript was so good.</p><h3>Algorithms</h3><h4>Body movement recognition</h4><p>In the initial stage of our development, we investigated existing body movement recognition algorithms. Currently, mainstream algorithms are mostly based on analyzing sequential video frames. Although these algorithms could meet our requirements, the networks are fairly complicated and running inference on them consumes a lot of computational resources. But since one of our hard requirements was to run the model on mobile devices, we had to make a tradeoff between accuracy and performance.</p><p>Our approach was to first acquire key human body joints through PoseNet, and then recognize specific actions based on the sequence of body joint movement. Since PoseNet tracks only 17 body joints, the amount of computation was significantly reduced, as compared to the full size image. Below we show the workflow of our algorithm: first we used PoseNet to extract body joint data from input video, and then we carried out action classifications based on the body joint data.</p><figure><img alt="How to acquire human body joints using PoseNet" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*l2-0uiXDWkFT8Ss-" /></figure><h4>Key actions</h4><p>After deciding on the technical approach, we needed to define the key body movements important to recognize for the app. To do this, we transformed the body movement recognition problem to a typical machine learning classification problem. Below is a sample of how we defined the key Baduanjin movements:</p><figure><img alt="Chart of key Baduanjin movements" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*CFKMKk67EVUmkEQw" /></figure><p>We trained a traditional deep neural network to classify user body movements. After several iterations of hyperparameter tuning and training data optimization/augmentation, our final model had good accuracy and was able to satisfy our product requirements, as shown below.</p><figure><img alt="Accuracy vs. Gesture graph" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*B7z0TObHpPYW7Rp7" /></figure><h4>Challenges on mobile devices</h4><p>After finishing the deep learning model, our next step was to deploy our models on iOS and Android mobile devices. At first, we tried TensorFlow Mobile. But since we needed to get recognition results in real time, TensorFlow Mobile was not a viable option since its performance did not meet this requirement.</p><p>As we were trying to solve the performance challenge, Google released <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite">TensorFlow Lite</a>, which was a big leap from TensorFlow Mobile in terms of performance. We compare the two offerings below:</p><figure><img alt="Table comparing TensorFlow Mobile and TensorFlow Lite" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/601/0*smCg1K44hK5bbFS3" /></figure><p>We also show the initial benchmark results on our model below:</p><figure><img alt="Initial benchmark results" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/601/0*P2-6GKD-8JATDM_F" /></figure><p>Based on the benchmark numbers, we concluded that it wasn’t feasible to do body movement recognition in real time on most Android devices based on a 512x512 input size. To solve this problem, we profiled our machine learning models and found that PoseNet was the bottleneck, which consumed 95% of the computational time. So we adjusted PoseNet input size and hyperparameters, and retrained our action recognition algorithm to compensate for the accuracy loss introduced by reduced input size. In the end, we chose 337x337 RGB as the input and 0.5 as the width multiplier for MobileNet on Android.</p><p>Our target users are mostly elderly, so they tend to have lower-end devices. Even though we improved the performance by adjusting PoseNet parameters, it was still not satisfactory. Therefore, we resorted to the ubiquitous accelerator in smartphones: GPU. Google happened to release <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/gpu">TensorFlow Lite GPU delegate (experimental)</a> around that time, which saved us plenty of engineering resources.</p><p>Mobile GPU considerably accelerated our model execution. Below is our benchmark on several popular devices among our users, with and without GPU delegate.</p><figure><img alt="Benchmark on several popular devices among our users, with and without GPU delegate." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*l3UAaZ3K_DpBWTJ-" /></figure><p>Since Baduanjin moves are relatively slow for older users, our product could run smoothly on most devices after integrating TensorFlow Lite GPU delegate (experimental).</p><figure><img alt="Animated Banduanjin movement" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/393/0*3Cec85GK3VvuMLVU" /></figure><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>We successfully finished our Smart Baduanjin product on both iOS and Android, and have received positive feedback from our testing users. By leveraging ML technology and TensorFlow, we provided a ‘tutorial model’ for Baduanjin beginners so that they can follow the demo video and learn the moves. For experienced Baduanjin practitioners, we provided valuable feedback such as scores to help them further improve their skills. Currently, ‘Smart Baduanjin’ is available for free in both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/hk/app/%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E5%85%AB%E6%AE%B5%E9%8C%A6/id1410056117">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.familyfit.google.baduanjin&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, OliveX is actively exploring applying human body pose estimation to other fitness exercises. We found that many other exercise practices are just like Baduanjin, in that the correctness of the practitioners’ body movements matters a lot. Correct body movements not only help people avoid bodily injury, but also increase their exercise efficiency. Thus, we want to transfer the knowledge and skills we obtained from the Baduanjin project to other domains as well.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2a4e2d5159c8" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/tensorflow/body-movement-recognition-in-the-smart-baduanjin-app-2a4e2d5159c8">Body movement recognition in the ‘Smart Baduanjin’ App</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/tensorflow">TensorFlow</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

        <p>The Picard Team is proud to announce the release of MusicBrainz Picard 2.2. This version provides a number of new features and bug fixes. Some of the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can be moved to sub folders without renaming the actual file (see below for details).</li>
<li>Colors used for highlighting changes in files and metadata can now be configured in options.</li>
<li>A new integrated media player toolbar. This feature is considered beta and is disabled by default, but you can enable the toolbar in the menu with View &gt; Player. Please note that the file formats supported by the player depend on your operating system.</li>
<li>New plugin hooks which trigger when a file was added to a release, a file was removed from a release, a file was saved and a file was loaded.</li>
<li>Improved support for dropping cover art images directly from Google and Bing image search results.</li>
<li>Support for ReplayGain 2.0 tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few potentially backward incompatible changes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon cover art moved to plugin:</strong> If you have been using the Amazon cover art you will need to install the Amazon Cover Art plugin in Options &gt; Plugins. The functionality remains the same, we just moved it to a plugin.</li>
<li><strong>Moving files without renaming creates folder structure:</strong> Previously Picard would just drop all files into the selected target folder if &#8220;Move files&#8221; was enabled but &#8220;Rename files&#8221; was disabled. This was not very useful. Now Picard will generate the folder hierarchy according to your script.<br />
If you want to retain the old functionality use a renaming script that does not generate any folder hierarchy (no slash or backslash characters in the script).</li>
<li><strong>The minimum supported macOS version is now macOS Sierra (10.12) or higher.</strong> If you are using macOS 10.10 or 10.11 you can continue using Picard 2.1.3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Picard 2.2 is available for download on the <a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/downloads/">Picard website</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody who contributed to this release with code, translations, testing, bug reports and general feedback. This is much appreciated and we are always happy to see new contributors.</p>

<p>It’s time for another server update! This release mostly includes small improvements to make the MusicBrainz site show data in places where it was missing and have more clear messages for the users. We have a lot of other small improvements in the pipeline which we hope to release in the next couple of updates, so if this doesn’t help with any of your pet peeves hopefully those will!</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://susi.ai/">SUSI.AI</a> app, I found the extensive use of “Retrofit” to make API calls to the server. While working on a part of the app, I faced some difficulty regarding the implementation of “Retrofit”.&nbsp; Though I learned and overcame the problems, I realized that others would face a similar problem. So, today I am writing this blog explaining how to implement “Retrofit” using the help of “<a href="https://susi.ai/">SUSI.AI</a>” android client.<br></p>



<p><strong>Working of API Calls:</strong></p>



<p>Android networking or any networking works in the following way:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Request</strong>— An HTTP request is made to a certain URL, with all the supplied parameters.</li><li><strong>Response</strong> — The request created returns a response, usually in the JSON format.</li><li><strong>Parse &amp; Store</strong> —The JSON returned is parsed and is being used accordingly.</li></ul>



<p>In Android, we use —</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://square.github.io/okhttp/">Okhttp</a> — For creating an HTTP request with all the proper headers</li><li><a href="https://square.github.io/retrofit/">Retrofit</a> — For making the request</li><li>Moshi / GSON — For parsing the JSON data</li><li>Kotlin Coroutines — For making non-blocking (main thread) network requests.</li><li>Picasso / Glide— For downloading an image from the internet and setting it into an ImageView.</li></ul>



<p>Obviously, these are just some of the popular libraries but there are others too.<br></p>



<p><strong>How to use Retrofit?</strong></p>



<p>First of all we need to import certain libraries in the app level gradle file.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LJTaACMEOlii_8hDzZOP8rf4Wh8Psyq_GRid0-VtrgkaSPQnLh-nVqRkJrpwTJuV4_AKUiVdRCEyps00M5fC7ry66HCC640m-sjHLEB3WUvmisAOe5R5wXgkv2i27ccTq2IprumS" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Don’t forget to add the following in the manifest file.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9JEzt8HPB2r4hXOo0ZbaUPhbTeesM-Zapm8QtHmLyF0TmlHR3L_vF_WFlfMq7oUHINpD_wwSUy0zi_Qil10yv39Xg852a4zqhznm4YgKN10Fum3uzps4SrKTUZ2O9V4XWi3rUd3k" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Now, create an interface. The API link mentioned in the interface would be used to fetch data from the server.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5R4gzZZkhOTWZINl5a5meJR-qTdJRU-JMJj0c-6EAPVeDUgrsfIkg8WVRwQ1ArmSSTRu7Oepm2dkHKW4eYxMo4iqSkpVYSmTyRB78aqMF_6NK2qDv9wipPYwgcNVlfPNcbyQIheH" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Now create a class to parse the JSON data. &nbsp;Here, we have used a Gson Converter and so the JSON response is automatically converted to the respective.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4hIbthAAqihl4Xtp0MfXN38SKcL_wDTIjSpvnZaGb9D3yArPQApO46XBtLSnHojtAk86zgXX6RTnS36OvHFOQZirX8gAb3269q3XH86POcSsecKPM7Jb9ED--iXyvjko3q7h0FT0" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Here Session and Settings are also a data class. These data classes are framed according to the response that we receive.<br></p>



<p>Now, create a Retrofit Builder with Base URL and GsonConverterFactory. This builder will be useful to make the API calls.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/l_VGUIVqQ7P0oQCbFqG2WJb80GtfNjoRpkQPJ7ddUP1cc3UoLTCMlx1USKfjdJoLV02wSyFTeT_MT5_YHj1tOYmdWl1LEUsL8fAnIPkoY7N32gozHKeh13Cbdma8IPR4UExVQoOc" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Create a service for Retrofit with your service interface. Then, create a queue which will be used to de-serialize the JSON.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/u3zhijIZ93H70rIcjnmJDC5eYUi6lK57qwzUCoWJf_VDfeFXsHHYndPJugbx8oHZBU5B5mMfMSsuhgYHWgm2zVVGlmMLOnYQ7v6UlkLW968XmSeGe5aKvfeJC2SyLra5-FgculXW" alt="" /></figure>

<p>What do you understand by “Planned Actions”? Is it something required to do something according to plan? Is it something that needs to be done at a particular time? Yes, it is. “Planned Actions” is a feature present in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi&amp;hl=en">SUSI.AI</a> android app that helps to schedule tasks. Yes, you heard it right! It helps to schedule the task. We can schedule some events like “setting an alarm after one minute”, “playing music after one minute”, etc. Such events require scheduling of different events at different point of time.<br></p>



<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi&amp;hl=en">SUSI.AI</a> is a smart assistant. It answers the queries that the user asks for, play music, etc. Additionally, the project also has a smart speaker part, which is very similar to Google Home. A smart speaker often has the ability to perform certain task other than answering normal queries at a scheduled time. During my GSoC period, I got the opportunity to implement such a feature of scheduling task in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi&amp;hl=en">SUSI.AI</a> android app.<br></p>



<p><strong>What is the scheduling of task or planned action?</strong></p>



<p>Scheduling of task or planned actions is nothing but performing some kind of task at a scheduled time. Let’s consider <strong>“set alarm in one minute</strong>”. This means an alarm should be set that should ring up after one minute. </p>



<p>Let’s see how it has been implemented in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi&amp;hl=en">SUSI</a>.<br></p>



<p>First of all, we need to have a skill that would respond to the query asked. Consider, the skill “<strong>rocket launch</strong>”. The response for this skill is:<br></p>

<p>The response for the above skill can be received by querying “rocket launch” at <a href="https://api.susi.ai/">https://api.susi.ai/</a>  or you can get it by going directly to the following link <a href="https://api.susi.ai/susi/chat.json?timezoneOffset=-330&amp;q=Rocket+Launch">https://api.susi.ai/susi/chat.json?timezoneOffset=-330&amp;q=Rocket+Launch</a><br></p>



<p>The skill acts as a count-down timer of rocket launch. Now, we have a skill, but how are we going to implement it in android app, so that the countdown timer works properly and the output appears at the proper scheduled time. Also, we need to take care that the other processes of the app doesn’t stop or hangs up when some events are scheduled. Going through all these problems and circumstances I came up with a solution. So, let’s have a look. I made use of Handler.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Handler in Android helps to execute some tasks at a scheduled time. The tasks are executed in a different thread other than the Main UI thread. So, the other process in the app doesn’t stops and it runs smoothly.<br></p>



<p>Let’s have a look at the code:<br></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>for</strong> (i <strong>in</strong> 0 <strong>until</strong> actionSize) {<br><br> &nbsp; <strong>if</strong> (susiResponse.answers[0].actions[i].plan_delay.toString().isNullOrEmpty()) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; planDelay = 0L<br> &nbsp; } <strong>else</strong> {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; planDelay = susiResponse.answers[0].actions[i].plan_delay<br> &nbsp; }<br> &nbsp; executeTask(planDelay, susiResponse, i, date)<br> &nbsp; chatView?.hideWaitingDots()<br>}</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>The code above, loops through all the actions mentioned in the skill one by one. After parsing it, the data is passed to a function <strong>executeTask(). </strong>This function performs the task to schedule the events (plan actions).<br></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>handler = Handler()<br>try {<br> &nbsp; handler.postDelayed({<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; val parseSusiHelper = ParseSusiResponseHelper()<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<strong>if</strong> (parseSusiHelper.actionType == Constant.TABLE) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tableItem = parseSusiHelper.tableData<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } <strong>else</strong> <strong>if</strong> (parseSusiHelper.actionType == Constant.VIDEOPLAY || parseSusiHelper.actionType == Constant.AUDIOPLAY) {<br> &nbsp;

<p>The variable planDelay determines the time after which the task needs to be executed. By default its value is 0, i.e, it gets executed at that moment only until any delay time is supplied by the skill.<br></p>



<p>In this way, planned actions have been implemented in<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi&amp;hl=en"> SUSI.AI</a> Android app.<br></p>

<p>Displaying images is not so easy in an Android app without using a third-party library. Picasso is one of the most popularly used third-party libraries for android that is used to display images. It is a very simple and powerful library for image downloading and caching. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi">SUSI.AI</a> is a smart assistant app. We need the use of Picasso a lot to answer the queries put up by the users. Suppose if the user asks to show some pictures, we need to display it. In such a case we find Picasso very handy. So let&#8217;s know how to implement it, by going through the code base present in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi"><strong>SUSI.AI</strong></a> android app.<br></p>



<p><strong>Why use Picasso or another third-party library?</strong></p>



<p>You might be thinking that why we should use a 3rd party library. You can achieve your task without using a 3rd party API as well. But if you will use the core method then it would take a larger amount of code. But if we will use a 3rd party library like Picasso then we will achieve our goal in fewer lines of code.&nbsp; Also, we can easily cache the images using this libraries. Caching is really an important feature to speed up the application.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Adding Picasso Library to the Gradle file</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3vnzVoi7IJJBJGS2AVc_PTVHajfScZUTAQNpq13pghTYAe_fxM9guj08grZxxJ2iVj7X3LZxBdunFif5K7rbUqjQJYZpeDLsRH96-vY8OL7Pw0cgNxUsyscj7oEe5N76lf8uMBsL" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Adding Picasso android library to your project is very easy. You just need to add the following line in the dependency block of your build.gradle file and replace <strong>${rootConfiguration.picassoVersion}</strong> with the latest version of Picasso(for example 2.71828). Now sync your Gradle file. I am assuming that you have already added <strong>NETWORK</strong> permission in your project.<br></p>



<p>The simplest way of loading image is:<br></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Picasso.with(this)
   .load("YOUR IMAGE URL HERE")
   .into(imageView);
</code></pre>



<p>Here, imageView is the reference to the imageView where you want to display the image.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IUJD6EoWCNzrmCDgNqs_0iSjk8h9rruxmPy68cN3O9eoZnGwur19rrSnSc-_ncrY1MYFlDQeOfKIc7Hqhgm_mtxdygefBQw1vMukNN04OkyPjR90L7Sllf6_gNOeBZyVkiXbR6wm" alt="" /></figure>



<p>This is how it is being implemented in the susi app. Here imageUrl is the URL of the image to be loaded. ImageView is the place where we need to display the loaded image. Now there is a chance that the imageUrl is actually not a URL of the image, or suppose Picasso fails to load the image due to some errors. In all such cases, a dummy image would be shown in the imageView. This dummy image is added by calling the error function of Picasso class and passing the reference of the image to it. The placeholder function displays a static image present inside the app until the actual image is being loaded.<br></p>



<p><strong>Re-sizing and Rotating</strong></p>



<p>We can also resize and rotate the image very easily.<br></p>

<p>A large application always consists of some kinds of a database to keep a store of large chunks of data that it receives from the server. One such database is the Realm Database.</p>



<p>While working on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi&amp;hl=en">SUSI.AI</a> app (a smart assistant open-source app) I found the necessity to store room name in the database. These room names were used while configuring <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/susi_installer">SUSI Smart Speake</a>r using the app. Let me share how I implemented this in the app.<br></p>



<p>Before we proceed with the implementation, let’s go through the&nbsp; prerequisites for using Realm with Android:</p>



<ul><li>Android Studio version 1.5.1 or higher</li><li>JDK version 7.0 or higher</li><li>A recent version of the Android SDK</li><li>Android API Level 9 or higher (Android 2.3 and above)</li></ul>



<p>First of all, you need to add the Gradle dependency at the app level.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QFiHFyM2zC9mECIrSo74GeaxXMpgrAGSgXWdfhqE8iDxiURw6Q2Sike5fc5RnXlGS_iCklwf_2y3ghsxd-vm_-clWp30oDusBYm2Yw7shHD5RW7BdApLP_6h8dfvW7eUQm5luAz0" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Since we are going to do it in Kotlin, we need to add the following:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/A5d_2mrSolrARlKMgy0tlaOk3txtS4k30stYS4Uma7DNQXFFQ-5onnJfmjPoYM9p7VpgMm6zVhYewRBcjbQc0kZvfaUKTNvDeG3bSn0BS9pjgJEVaNWKaIigCTxhsieLTkJ4bjtj" alt="" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oMSQVKTO_PlaRB96xLLvNJ-7Iw8igolgroKtib84rzqNcPGpeIhtHpfpMKYiacxsoLtNcgSvcpKMEtKexoCXMNCgAzSPM9TkQR-aH_peJvg28DBwKWrVtc0eOfxUEptrClnVnChI" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Since this is a database that is used throughout the application, we have to initialize the realm in the class that extends the Application class.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_zWvKbBoz5taC3n5a3_Dp2zUzk0V7EgRz62y31reIzy2GEPD4xO9xGOJnf7J8_6OfnQxTfm2L3dUdSJh_1fsc-2A6Dsr753h7pWnaoHRxXNZqRlB3BFoYQgbK9hz-i6ipgKGPGB4" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Once the realm is initialized, we set up a data model class. This model class contains the format of data to be stored. The model class should extend the RealmObject class. Also, the model class must use the keyword open. This makes it available for inheritance and allows it to be overridden. If we remove the open keyword here, we get an error stating: cannot inherit from the final model class.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the realm objects are initialized at the start, the default values of the variables are declared null (Concept of Function Default&nbsp; Arguments in Kotlin).<br></p>



<p>Now to manipulate the database from the required files we need to create a reference to the Realm followed by getting the default instance of Realm.<br></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/RtNGZ1Wt7QWtdBCc2ozEmIesj4OGJ-bjO6oDOTux8FqoXP502QPRc7kMPSZy3EegFmo-lPx7ZzQLv-QHNLS0txKxY-RxWddZpV4dPnnVnt8ICcP6_rAjZwOTJYRaVdgzk1DJx4ye" alt="" /><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure></div>

<p></p>



<p>To commit any operation with the database, the code must be written within beginTransaction and commitTransaction blocks. Below is an example where the room name is added to the database by using the model class mentioned above.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nJjOsc6nN5RsIszHhUpC3Zoq0ufI2WegjjSXtetYPZnhdcYCaJA_9ju2HMnypZaZi9eVL76-ERmxYe_nNDcqcFGB9dePeajhcxiEOVETzHJ6pLwD2-tSO6NOn66XGvoN5w3FFHDg" alt="" /></figure>



<p>We use the above method to add data to the database. Now, if we can add data, we should be able to retrieve them too. Let&#8217;s go through the code snippet to retrieve data from the database.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ua5uY7VVuovtQ4s2ndDpFgoScgwyj1koMJoyj639-Y6e1aF1yf3PE7y95YLTaQivoMwcynQBfAVnEc1aUZF90t8rQDCV2tlQ2nrbD81-iZrn87dHuHwxnUol5EGyAUuVs0wRaDpN" alt="" /></figure>



<p>The above snippet shows a function which extracts data from the database and stores them in an array list for displaying in a recycler view.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Now, we all went through addition, display of data in the realm database. Is that sufficient?? No, if we can add data to the database, then there also should be a way to delete the data when needed. Clearing/removing data all at once from the database is very easy and can be simply done by :</p>

<p>While working on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi&amp;hl=en">SUSI.AI</a> app (a smart assistant app), I found the necessity of handling UI components along with background data queue. While initializing a text to speech(TTS) engine inside a fragment that already had a speech to text (stt) engine implemented, there was a necessity to run the TTS engine to run using handler and later make it interact with the main UI thread. Let&#8217;s see how I handled this situation in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi&amp;hl=en">SUSI.AI</a> app.<br></p>



<p>Android usually handles all the UI operations and input events from one single thread which is known as the Main or UI thread. Android collects all events in this thread in a queue and processes this queue. If one needs to perform some tasks in parallel with the main thread, then the main thread needs to be synchronized. Each handler is associated with a thread. A handler is a way to solve the asynchronous problem in Android.<br></p>



<p>A handler is widely used for:</p>



<ul><li>Managing and inserting messages in the queue</li><li>Performing a task at a scheduled time in a different thread</li><li>Implementing runnable&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>How Handlers work?</strong><br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0TQjf_Jyp-1adXxt9WWz3fTEx4EbuehvvVHcjqOynyD1QPVzlM6XeHLZDZWYdbCC1v--c40YCrMbg2LBJpV3_vf65oKx9UedDTrL9ne0vr_2QxPoZxlZDFr0OclxsEV7WnBXOPc6" alt="" /></figure>



<p>A handler is used to send and process Message and Runnable objects associated with a thread. Each handler is associated with a different single thread. This helps to perform the task asynchronously. The task, messages or runnable associated with that handlers are executed when it comes out of the message queue.</p>



<p>In Android, Handler is mainly used to update the main thread from background thread or other than the main thread. There are two methods in the handler:</p>



<ul><li>Post() − it posts a message from background thread to the main thread using looper.</li><li>sendmessage() − if we want to organize what we have sent to UI (message from background thread) or UI functions. we should use sendMessage().</li></ul>



<p><strong>Construction of Handler:</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EZ0dc_1P9hm6tziXTMIUzPUp_hS2g1lzm8ecbKcULAqVuBccXIBrh7HrbbD_RRoVkuUMMgOWqbd_21ULPR-j0nTDy7bz00koHcSh_PvhaQvaiza2Uy-k-WkvZ3fakAVx97epSZsS" alt="" /></figure>



<p>First of all, we need to create and reference to Handler. After Handler is being created, we create some runnable objects. These runnable objects get executed inside the Handler.<br></p>



<p><strong>Construction of Runnables that can be used in the handler:</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xbqzDzfH3bHPL8ej_cTnmNxZbu4VhUkBnIfHn4j3P8LP43tctoXEjGJxHTkCDL-ooSsbJIL1LJO9PLrbPEkksV4dF1NXhBM9RZ39p07TzgPY_TCfFGif818t2FiocaVLITqQMh6h" alt="" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u3u-HUlIOUX72zpTaK32Q4oaHL7qyIsOilq4M-NdvKLKzRdBGbGUHPgZ86Rimy1b1GmSqKp5NEOLK3uS8fH84pLiMJ9jLHPQmj863wlX1PmToPOrXs5OiWcIDbasyGumWStpTdZR" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Here, in this example, I have used the Post method to update the main thread.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Cn3k5AGZfe-kAZEL7dwzmsIrZ1rIFWwM_gT5638XXaE8anlT0FLJTJsJf1VQmHUTykdLgZR-26iTlv0l9ghGgn5yuY6ddYavVEoWapWZrGWK4H8_4VxJCrLD2F_GdXD4oaWMNKsW" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Clearly, the post method is used in the handler object to execute the task mentioned in the runnable, by using its reference. Also, we can see the use of postDelayed function. This function executes the runnable after a specific span of time(mentioned in milliseconds in the parameter along with the runnable reference).<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ouJgyYbrpAhABzuItUpxDlmCfdSu6G3NTrStaAuuRJ4NQkerlj-sg9HqzbDnBsEzsYdX6JIjmkISjwDFiIR1ejumhlyIuXeXEDydGrPYHKIQqtfWLQkzkC-zE8Km82ZG8vYpIgbs" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Lastly, it is very important to note that we should clear all the references to the handlers during the destruction of the view or the activity else there might be memory leaks.&nbsp;<br></p>

The students team will have the support of a Senior Advisory Board with a dozen professionals with large experience on Aerospace projects.<br /><br />Next autumn&nbsp;the agenda will include many activities theoretical and practical. First, students will assist to technical talks from experts on the field, and will travel abroad to see aerospatial installations, like some NASA centers in US. Also will start to work on the development on projects such as Nano Satellites, Probe Balloons, Rockets, electronic circuits for spatial communications and specifically developed software, among others specifically ideated for our Liquid Galaxy project, like Satellite orbits representation.</div><br />

<h2>How to Join the Contest</h2>



<ul><li>The contest is open to <strong>everyone</strong>. </li><li>Participants can join at <strong>any time</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Register on the <a href="https://codeheat.org">site</a> and check out the<a href="https://codeheat.org/#faq"> Frequently Asked Questions</a> for more details.</li><li>Also join the <a href="https://gitter.im/fossasia/fossasia">FOSSASIA Gitter chat</a> and communicate with mentors and follow developers on project specific channels.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>What are the Prizes</h2>



<ul><li>Winners (3 prizes): Listed on website, certificate, 600SGD travel voucher, 5-night accommodation in Singapore, Tshirt and FOSSASIA limited edition swags.&nbsp;</li><li>Finalist (7 prizes): Listed on website, certificate, travel voucher of 100 SGD, Tshirt and FOSSASIA limited edition swags.&nbsp;</li><li>Active Contributors (unlimited): Certificate, CodeHeat Tshirt and FOSSASIA limited edition of swags (with at least 10 merged pull requests)</li><li>Community Participants (unlimited): Digital Certificate of Participation (with at least 5 merged pull requests)</li></ul>



<h2>What are the Judging Criteria</h2>



<p>Our jury will review the work of the 10 developers who have the highest number of quality contributions during the contest. Contributions include pull requests/code commits, scrum reports, articles, screencasts, community engagement and outreach activities. The mentors will look at the:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Sustainability</strong>, which means that we specifically value contributions that make the project sustainable by building a community where developers collaborate with each other in a friendly way and support the project development through peer reviews, on-boarding new members, and helping fellow contributors. It also means that, while code is the most important success criteria for winning the contest, furthermore we are looking for contributions in other areas to make projects easy to join, to deploy and to use. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>creating and enhancing documentation</li><li>developing how-tos</li><li>writing technical blog posts</li><li>sharing work in regular scrum updates to enhance communication</li><li>organizing local meetups, workshops, presentations&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Quality vs. Quantity:</strong> The sheer number of pull requests is not the only criteria for choosing the winners. Quality work is appreciated &#8211; some issues are more challenging than others just by their nature (for example, heavy coding versus solving a text typo bug). It is entirely possible that someone who completed 53 issues could be chosen as a winner over someone who completed 88 issues.</p>



<h2>How Are the Winners Decided</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Grand Prize Winners</strong>: Three developers will be selected by mentors from the top 10 contributors according to code quality, relevance of commits and contributions that help to bring the project forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Finalist Winners</strong>: After the grand prize winners are selected, the remaining seven contributors of top the 10 will receive finalist winner prizes.</li><li><strong>Other contributors</strong> who have more than 10 merged pull requests during the contest will receive a Thank you package. Anyone who has 5 pull requests merged will receive a digital certificate.</li></ul>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SuZ9W-j0MRqlIygN5-5n9lxX1Ltn48JYOKgtNDTAemmotYz38Eaft4Kd2PuJzm2iGT0LZ5pgD-ryAdLcnoC3kCG3vjnPUHh3xg0ltqHq0qmbj05rEVmjkieYqMoiesvy8tGvkWB8" alt="" /></figure>



<p>The shimmer effect was created by Facebook to indicate the loading of data in pages where data is being loaded from the internet. This was created as an alternative for the existing ProgressBar and the usual loader to give better user experience with UI.<br></p>



<p><strong>Let&#8217;s get started</strong> to see how we can implement it. Here, I am going to use<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi&amp;hl=en"> SUSI.AI </a>(a smart assistant app) as a reference app to show a code demonstration. I am working on this project in my GSoC period and while working I found the need to implement this feature in many places. So, I am writing this blog to share my experience with how, I implemented it in the app.<br></p>



<p>First of all, we need to add the shimmer dependency in the app level Gradle file.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vAaATzljJ0VvC9FFPx1Dz6f_J1cKqJPXE6nny2RTjf4O3uckkRZeP7h7WvJn9Fh49l3Eq9R5KV5pp74zpjv3p0x3bPWELnepkaxFcIKVJP-N8sdFG_vPgGdt-V4qafWfApPu2AEx" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Now, we need to create a placeholder layout simply by using views. This placeholder should resemble the actual layout. Usually, grey-colored is preferred in the placeholder background. A placeholder should not have any text written. It should be viewed only. Let’s consider the placeholder used in susi.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/HIqRdmYYf6vkyBGeV02-m4EN-S01ytlb22R2NIzcy8AzZNLOxTPAISxbr7PTs1bNSiqImGh5V79N0lwbxYZ_2DQcqEJ0wdFzp31aDbeoiVZXRWy-K0tpAtQgIVWOs9cR65XfNLsv" alt="" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Now let&#8217;s have a glance at the actual items whose placeholders we have made.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TdYXsa95yzW4EGXh3XkvxJ1iJa8WubFVaY8iP5JCN_bmprK6c1hfTea9Og2srgpwexrZ5cpwFSZJhcel7qjXQ6y-My6TFnQG_7RTAC1DNk4gXdb86Ho-6I5QdgrE8jbSg-mIYJmT" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Now, after the creation of the placeholder, we need to add this placeholder in the main layout file. It is done in the following way:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QWNPyhRUubJfjSCOG19mHAGzdGTRfKM6vLLuRYhoSgM_HYfDEAVICvwCpOqTK6Q2AB8wEZw9tbFW6hLT9SnIXqCLHdkTsD8YDsy19B-tvnR3vzpfxF6seGHOmxZi-eu_obN8K5xX" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Here, I have added the placeholders 6 times so that the entire screen gets covered up. You can add it as many times as you want.<br></p>



<p>The next and the final task is to start and stop the shimmer effect according to the logic of the code. Here, the shimmer starts as soon as the fragment is created and stops when the data is successfully loaded from the server. Have a look at how to create the reference.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cEanUxhGLA96HbXAMHr0o3WVKcz-bPayRWxGpf_DkDJ8KECTWFVQQImCMLh-R2BTw-q-OfGEE5yfqf_Z1PrjDMSmIjb-0Xv-B664XV8BbJVrSgkWb8_FJb_U9Q52rw-4tnrMnmV6" alt="" /></figure>



<p>First of all, we need to create a reference to the shimmer. Then we use this reference to start/stop the shimmer effect. Here, in Kotlin we can directly use the id used in layout without creating any reference.<br></p>



<p>We start the shimmer effect simply by using startShimmer() function in the shimmer reference.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KYJQBvMovYCh6aS79_FHP-w9HasIuJTvnROH7qNbb4EWWSYaM0U_dVAGtmBbj6YJxoatp6rEvJ7l9ssVk0s3ruMcN1DXDhFFEg_tyE-ubXJpb2X533ngOeYIO8tiQDlBvNDMxqfr" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Similarly, we can stop it using stopShimmer() function in the reference.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cbm0qW3RzmxANQp8NlYcvXwNkGUn2VofAqYiVP99ru-9GE-iXthJf8fuI6qskP8mxKsqMBmJGxYCXn5YKv82vjDIo8zU4Z4IDyWwAbAipIHSpiS_Rv7nic_zsGb0VN7RVTRMf0_" alt="" /></figure>

<p>Gestures have become one of the most widely used features by a user. The user usually, expects that some tasks should be performed by the app when he or she executes some gestures on the screen.</p>



<p>A &#8220;touch gesture&#8221; occurs when a user places one or more fingers on the touch screen, and your application interprets that pattern of touches as a particular gesture. There are correspondingly two phases to gesture detection:</p>



<ol><li>Gather data about touch events.</li><li>Interpret the data to see if it meets the criteria for any of the gestures your app supports.</li></ol>



<p>There are various kinds of gestures supported by android. Some of them are:</p>



<ul><li>Tap</li><li>Double Tap</li><li>2-finger Tap</li><li>2-finger-double tap</li><li>3-finger tap</li><li>Pinch</li></ul>



<p>In this post, we will go through the<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi&amp;hl=en"> SUSI.AI </a>android app (a smart assistant app) which has the <strong><em>“Right to left swipe”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>gesture detector in use. When such kind of gesture is detected inside the Chat Activity, it opens the Skill’s Activity. This makes the app very user-friendly.<strong><em> </em></strong>Before we start implementing the code,&nbsp; go through the steps mentioned above in detail.</p>



<p><strong>1st Step “Gather Data”:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When a user places one or more fingers on the screen, this triggers the callback onTouchEvent() on the View that received the touch events. For each sequence of touch events (position, pressure, size, the addition of another finger, etc.) that is ultimately identified as a gesture, onTouchEvent() is fired several times.</p>



<p>The gesture starts when the user first touches the screen, continues as the system tracks the position of the user&#8217;s finger(s), and ends by capturing the final event of the user&#8217;s fingers leaving the screen. Throughout this interaction, the MotionEvent delivered to onTouchEvent() provides the details of every interaction. Your app can use the data provided by the MotionEvent to determine if a gesture it cares about happened.</p>



<p><strong>2nd Step “Data Interpretation”:</strong></p>



<p>The data received needs to be properly interpreted. The gestures should be properly recognized and processed to perform further actions. Like an app might have different gestures integrated into the same page live <strong>“Swipe-to-refresh”, “Double-tap”, “Single tap”, </strong>etc. Upon successfully differentiating this kind of gesture, further functions/tasks should be executed.</p>

<p><strong>Let&#8217;s go through the code present in</strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.susi&amp;hl=en"><strong> SUSI</strong></a><strong> now.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BHBKXXrUazW1M_DYGHQKuc-zaaq-lgNdgd_xgeZnlSAig5PTTjbeY7-8GakcVbevHvXII1mmdpmxkb-OTUFxh0iiuh3k_xKjYxIx1bMZYQ_VbjI4B2AY-tHC0lwzbDP0JUAPfjV_" alt="" /></figure>



<p>First of all, a new class is created here <strong>“CustomGestureListener”</strong>. This class extends the “<strong>SimpleOnGestureListener”</strong> which is a part of the<strong> “GestureDetector”</strong> library of android. This class contains a function “onFling”. This function determines the gestures across the horizontal axis.<strong> event1.getX()</strong>, and<strong> event2.getX()</strong> functions says about the gesture values across the horizontal axis of the device. Here, when the value of <strong>X </strong>becomes getter than 0, it actually indicates that the user has swiped from right to left. This becomes active even in very minor change, which users might have presses accidentally, or has just touched the screen. So to avoid such minor impulses, we set a value that we will execute our task only when the value of<strong> X</strong> lies between 100 and 1000. This avoids minor gestures.<br></p>

<p>Inside the onCreate method, a new CustomGestureListener instance is created, passing through a reference to the enclosing activity and an instance of our new CustomGestureListener class as arguments. Finally, an onTouchEvent() callback method is implemented for the activity, which simply calls the corresponding onTouchEvent() method of the ScaleGestureDetector object, passing through the MotionEvent object as an argument.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>



<p>Gestures are usually implemented to enhance the user experience while using the application. Though there are some predefined gestures in Android, we can also create gestures of our own and use them in our application.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-organizer-android">Open Event Organizer App (Eventyay Organizer App)</a> is an Android app based on the Eventyay platform. It contains various features using which organizers can manage their events.<br></p>



<p>This article will talk about a library which can help you create great about pages for Android apps without the need of making custom layouts.<br></p>



<p>It is the <a href="https://github.com/medyo/android-about-page">Android About Page</a> library.<br></p>



<p>Let’s go through the process of its implementation in the Eventyay Organizer App.<br></p>



<p>First add the dependency in the app level build.gradle file:<br></p>



<pre style='color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff'>implementation 'com.github.medyo:android-about-page:1.2.5'
</pre>
<!--Created using ToHtml.com on 2019-09-02 14:14:52 UTC -->



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Creating elements to be added:<br></p>



<pre style='color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff'>Element legalElement = new Element()<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>
legalElement.setTitle("Legal")<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>

Element developersElement = new Element()<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>      
developersElement.setTitle(getString(R.string.developers))<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>

Element shareElement = new Element()<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>
shareElement.setTitle(getString(R.string.share))<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>

Element thirdPartyLicenses = new Element()<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>       
thirdPartyLicenses.setTitle(getString(R.string.third_party_licenses))<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>
</pre>
<!--Created using ToHtml.com on 2019-09-02 14:24:04 UTC -->



<p>Setting image, description and adding items in the About Page:<br></p>



<pre style='color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff'>AboutPage aboutPage = new AboutPage(getContext())
            .isRTL(false)
            .setImage(R.mipmap.ic_launcher)            
            .setDescription(getString(R.string.about_us_description))
            .addItem(new Element("Version " + BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME, R.drawable.ic_info))
            .addGroup("Connect with us")
            .addGitHub("fossasia/open-event-organizer-android")
            .addPlayStore(getContext().getPackageName())
            .addWebsite(getString(R.string.FRONTEND_HOST))
            .addFacebook(getString(R.string.FACEBOOK_ID))
            .addTwitter(getString(R.string.TWITTER_ID))
            .addYoutube(getString(R.string.YOUTUBE_ID))
            .addItem(developersElement)
            .addItem(legalElement)
            .addItem(shareElement)<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>

if (BuildConfig.FLAVOR.equals("playStore")) <span style='color:#406080'>{</span>    
    aboutPage<span style='color:#308080'>.</span>addItem<span style='color:#308080'>(</span>thirdPartyLicenses<span style='color:#308080'>)</span><span style='color:#406080'>;</span>
<span style='color:#406080'>}</span>

View aboutPageView = aboutPage.create()<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>
</pre>
<!--Created using ToHtml.com on 2019-09-02 14:23:21 UTC -->



<p>Now add the aboutPageView in the fragment.</p>



<p></p>



<p>To make the values configurable from build.gradle, add this is the defaultConfig:<br></p>



<pre style='color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff'>resValue "string", "FACEBOOK_ID", "eventyay"
resValue "string", "TWITTER_ID", "eventyay"
resValue "string", "YOUTUBE_ID", "UCQprMsG-raCIMlBudm20iLQ"
</pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-organizer-android">Open Event Organizer Android App</a> is used by event organizers to manage events on the Eventyay platform. While creating or updating an event, location is one of the important factors which needs to be added so that the attendees can be informed of the venue.<br></p>



<p>Here, we’ll go through the process of implementing Mapbox Places Autocomplete for event location in the F-Droid build variant.<br></p>



<p>The first step is to create an environment variable for the Mapbox Access Token.&nbsp;<br></p>



<pre style='color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff'>def MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = System.getenv('MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN') ?: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
</pre>
<!--Created using ToHtml.com on 2019-09-02 13:51:58 UTC -->



<p>Add the Mapbox dependency:<br></p>

</pre>
<!--Created using ToHtml.com on 2019-09-02 13:52:18 UTC -->



<p>Fetching the access token in EventDetailsStepOne as well as UpdateEventFragment:<br></p>



<pre style='color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff'>ApplicationInfo applicationInfo = null<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>
        try <span style='color:#406080'>{</span>

</pre>
<!--Created using ToHtml.com on 2019-09-02 13:52:48 UTC -->



<p></p>



<p>The app should not crash if the access token is not available. To ensure this, we need to put a check. Since, the default value of the access token is set to “YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN”, the following code will check whether a token is available or not:<br></p>



<pre style='color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff'>if (mapboxAccessToken.equals("YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN")) <span style='color:#406080'>{</span>
    ViewUtils<span style='color:#308080'>.</span>showSnackbar<span style='color:#308080'>(</span>binding<span style='color:#308080'>.</span>getRoot<span style='color:#308080'>(</span><span style='color:#308080'>)</span><span style='color:#308080'>,</span>                             R<span style='color:#308080'>.</span>string<span style='color:#308080'>.</span>access_token_required<span style='color:#308080'>)</span><span style='color:#406080'>;</span>
    <span style='color:#200080;font-weight:bold'>return</span><span style='color:#406080'>;</span>
<span style='color:#406080'>}</span>
</pre>
<!--Created using ToHtml.com on 2019-09-02 13:53:08 UTC -->



<p>Initializing the PlacesAutocompleteFragment:<br></p>



<pre style='color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff'>PlaceAutocompleteFragment autocompleteFragment = PlaceAutocompleteFragment.newInstance(
                mapboxAccessToken, PlaceOptions.builder().backgroundColor(Color.WHITE).build())<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>

getFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
    .replace(R.id.fragment, autocompleteFragment)

    .commit()<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>
</pre>
<!--Created using ToHtml.com on 2019-09-02 13:53:25 UTC -->



<p>Now, a listener needs to be set up to get the selected place and set the various fields like latitude, longitude, location name and searchable location name.<br></p>



<pre style='color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff'>autocompleteFragment.setOnPlaceSelectedListener(new PlaceSelectionListener() <span style='color:#406080'>{</span>

<p>Android App Links are HTTP URLs that bring users directly to specific content in an Android app. They allow the website URLs to immediately open the corresponding content in the related Android app.<br></p>



<p>Whenever such a URL is clicked, a dialog is opened allowing the user to select a particular app which can handle the given URL.<br></p>



<p>In this blog post, we will be discussing the implementation of Android App Links for password reset in <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-organizer-android">Open Event Organizer App</a>, the Android app developed for event organizers using the <a href="https://eventyay.com">Eventyay platform</a>.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>What is the purpose of using App Links?</strong><br></p>



<p>App Links are used to open the corresponding app when a link is clicked.<br></p>



<ul><li>If the app is installed, then it will open on clicking the link.</li><li>If app is not installed, then the link will open in the browser.</li></ul>



<p>The first steps involve:<br></p>



<ol><li>Creating intent filters in the manifest.</li><li>Adding code to the app’s activities to handle incoming links.</li><li>Associating the app and the website with Digital Asset Links.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Adding Android App Links</strong><br></p>



<p>First step is to add an intent-filter for the AuthActivity.<br></p>



<pre style="color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff">&lt;intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" /&gt;

    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /&gt;
     &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" /&gt;

     &lt;data
         android:scheme="https"
         android:host="<span style="color:#7f9fbf;font-weight:bold">@string</span>/FRONTEND_HOST"
         android:pathPrefix="/reset-password" /&gt;
&lt;/intent-filter&gt;
</pre>
<!--Created using ToHtml.com on 2019-09-02 13:36:44 UTC -->



<p>Here, FRONTEND_HOST is the URL for the web frontend of the Eventyay platform.<br></p>



<p>This needs to be handled in AuthActivity:<br></p>



<pre style="color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff"><span style="color:#7f9fbf;font-weight:bold">@Override</span>
<span style="color:#200080;font-weight:bold">protected</span> void onNewIntent(Intent intent) <span style="color:#406080">{</span>

<p><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-organizer-android">Open Event Organizer App (Eventyay Organizer App)</a> is the Android app used by event organizers to create and manage events on the Eventyay platform.</p>



<p>Various features include:</p>



<ol><li>Event creation.</li><li>Ticket management.</li><li>Attendee list with ticket details.</li><li>Scanning of participants etc.</li></ol>



<p>The Play Store build variant of the app uses Google Vision API for scanning attendees. This cannot be used in the F-Droid build variant since F-Droid requires all the libraries used in the project to be open source. Thus, we’ll be using this library: <a href="https://github.com/blikoon/QRCodeScanner">https://github.com/blikoon/QRCodeScanner</a>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>We’ll start by creating separate ScanQRActivity, ScanQRView and activity_scan_qr.xml files for the F-Droid variant. We’ll be using a common ViewModel for the F-Droid and Play Store build variants.<br></p>



<p>Let’s start with requesting the user for camera permission so that the mobile camera can be used for scanning QR codes.<br></p>

<h1>Handling Planned Actions for the SUSI Smart Speaker&nbsp;</h1>



<p>Planned action is the latest feature added to the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/susi_linux">SUSI Smart Speaker</a>, The user now has the option to set timed actions such as-&nbsp; settings alarms, countdown timer etc. So the user now can say “SUSI, Set an alarm in one minute” and after one minute the smart speaker will notify you. <br><br>The following flowchart represents the workflow for the working of a planned action:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Li2DKUJnSP5GoB4L6XpApHSLLTUqEOSoVMBy7AwWANXD5A8dHm41N6VbPgjxmhj1KPZ3aXx3GytuJLt97eovJ_Yy3jaZOPKfACssabf62UEYFmpjxX2Z9o5Sq6HWmZWOV9c_vHlA" alt="" /></figure>



<h3>Planned Action Response<br><br></h3>



<p>The SUSI Server accepts the planned action query and sends a multi-action response which looks like this:&nbsp;</p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>&#8220;actions&#8221;: [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;language&#8221;: &#8220;en&#8221;,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;type&#8221;: &#8220;answer&#8221;,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;expression&#8221;: &#8220;alarm set for in 1 minute&#8221;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; },<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;expression&#8221;: &#8220;ALARM&#8221;,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;language&#8221;: &#8220;en&#8221;,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;type&#8221;: &#8220;answer&#8221;,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;plan_delay&#8221;: 60003,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;plan_date&#8221;: &#8220;2019-08-19T22:28:44.283Z&#8221;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ]</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p><br>Here we can see that we have two actions in the server response. The first action is of the type “answer” and is executed by the SUSI Linux client immediately, the other response has the `plan_date` and `plan_delay` keys which tells the BUSY State of the SUSI Linux client that this is a planned action and is then sent to the scheduler.<br></p>



<h3>Parsing Planned Action Response From The Server&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The SUSI python wrapper is responsible for parsing the response from the server and making it understandable to the SUSI Linux client. In SUSI Python we have classes which represent the different types of actions possible. The SUSI Python takes all the actions sent by the server and parses them into objects of different action types. To enable handling planned actions we add two more attributes to the base action class &#8211; `planned_date` and `planned_delay`.<br><br><br></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>class BaseAction:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; def __init__(self, plan_delay = None, plan_date = None):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.plan_delay = plan_delay<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.plan_date = plan_date<br><br>class AnswerAction(BaseAction):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; def __init__(self, expression, plan_delay = None, plan_date = None):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; super().__init__(plan_delay,plan_date)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.expression = expression</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p><br>Here we can see, All the action types which can be planned actions call the base class’ constructor to set the value for planned_delay and planned_date attributes.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The next step is to parse the different action type object and generate the final result<br></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>def generate_result(response):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; result = dict()<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; actions = response.answer.actions<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; data = response.answer.data<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; result[&#8220;planned_actions&#8221;] = []<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; for action in actions:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data = dict()<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if isinstance(action, AnswerAction):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if action.plan_delay != None and action.plan_date != None:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data[&#8216;answer&#8217;] = action.expression<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data[&#8216;plan_delay&#8217;] = action.plan_delay<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data[&#8216;plan_date&#8217;] = action.plan_date<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; result[&#8216;answer&#8217;] = action.expression<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if data != {}:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; result[&#8220;planned_actions&#8221;].append(data)</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>Here if the action object has a non none value for the planned attributes, the action object’s values are added to a planned actions list.<br><br></p>



<h3>Listening to Planned Actions in the SUSI Linux Client</h3>



<p>In the busy state, we see if the payload coming from the IDLE state is a query or a planned response coming from the scheduler. If the payload is a query, the query is sent to the server, otherwise the payload is executed directly<br><br></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>if isinstance(payload, str):<br>logger.debug(&#8220;Sending payload to susi server: %s&#8221;, payload)<br>reply = self.components.susi.ask(payload)<br>else :<br>logger.debug(&#8220;Executing planned action response&#8221;, payload)<br>reply = payload</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p><br>If the payload was a query and the server replies with a planned action response, then&nbsp;</p>



<p>The server response is sent to the scheduler.<br></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>if &#8216;planned_actions&#8217; in reply.keys():<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; for plan in reply[&#8216;planned_actions&#8217;]:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.components.action_schduler.add_event(int(plan[&#8216;plan_delay&#8217;])/1000,plan)</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p><br>The scheduler then schedules the event and send the payload to the IDLE state with the required delay. To trigger planned actions we implemented an event based observer using <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY">RxPy</a>. The listener resides in the idle state of the SUSI State Machine.&nbsp;<br></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if self.components.action_schduler is not None:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.components.action_schduler.subject.subscribe(<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on_next=lambda x: self.transition_busy(x))<br></td></tr></tbody></table>



<p><br>The observer in the IDLE state on receiving an event sends the payload to the busy state where it is processed. This is done by the transition_busy method which uses the allowedStateTransitions method.<br></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; def transition_busy(self,reply):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.transition(self.allowedStateTransitions.get(<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8216;busy&#8217;), payload=reply)</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>In this blog, I’ll explain the different API’s involved in the <a href="https://susi.ai/botWizard">SUSI.AI Bot Builder</a> and its working. Now if you are wondering how the SUSI.AI bot builder works or how <a href="https://susi.ai/mybots">drafts</a> are saved, then this is the perfect blog. I’ll be explaining the different API’s grouped by different API endpoints.</p>



<h2>API Implementation</h2>



<h3>fetchChatBots</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>export function fetchChatBots() {
 const url = `${API_URL}/${CMS_API_PREFIX}/getSkillList.json`;
 return ajax.get(url, {
   private: 1,
 });
}</code></pre>



<p>This API is used to fetch all your saved chatbots, which are displayed on the BotBuilder Page. The API endpoint is <strong>getSkillList.json</strong>. Same endpoint is used when a user creates a skill, the difference is query parameter private is passed which then returns your chatbots. Now if you are wondering why we have same endpoint for skills and chatbots, the simple plain reason for this is chatbots are your private skills.</p>



<h3>fetchBotDetails</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>export function fetchBotDetails(payload) {
 const { model, group, language, skill } = payload;
 const url = `${API_URL}/${CMS_API_PREFIX}/getSkill.json`;
 return ajax.get(url, {
   model,
   group,
   language,
   skill,
   private: 1,
 });
}</code></pre>



<p>This API is used to fetch details of bot/skill respectively from the API endpoint <strong>getSkill.json</strong>. Group name, language, skill name, private and model are passed as query parameters. </p>



<h3>fetchBotImages</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>export function fetchBotImages(payload) {
 const { name: skill, language, group } = payload;
 const url = `${API_URL}/${CMS_API_PREFIX}/getSkill.json`;
 return ajax.get(url, {
   group,
   language,
   skill,
   private: 1,
 });
}</code></pre>



<p>This API is used to fetch skill and bot images from the API endpoint <strong>getSkill.json</strong>. Group name, language, skill name and private are passed as query parameters.</p>



<h3>uploadBotImage</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>export function uploadBotImage(payload) {
 const url = `${API_URL}/${CMS_API_PREFIX}/uploadImage.json`;
 return ajax.post(url, payload, {
   headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' },
   isTokenRequired: false,
 });
}</code></pre>



<p>This API is used to upload the Bot image to the API endpoint <strong>uploadImage.json</strong>.The <strong>Content-Type</strong> entity header is used to indicate the media type of the resource. <strong>multipart/form-data</strong><em> </em>means no characters will be encoded. This is used when a form requires a binary data like the contents of a file or image to be uploaded.</p>



<h3>deleteChatBot</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>export function deleteChatBot(payload) {
 const { group, language, skill } = payload;
 const url = `${API_URL}/${CMS_API_PREFIX}/deleteSkill.json`;
 return ajax.get(url, {
   private: 1,
   group,
   language,
   skill,
 });
}</code></pre>



<p>This API is used to delete Skill and Bot from the API endpoint <strong>deleteSkill.json</strong>.</p>



<h3>storeDraft</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>export function storeDraft(payload) {
 const { object } = payload;
 const url = `${API_URL}/${CMS_API_PREFIX}/storeDraft.json`;
 return ajax.get(url, { object });
}</code></pre>



<p>This API is used to store draft Bot to the API endpoint <strong>storeDraft.json</strong>. The object passed as parameter has the properties given by the user such as skill name,group etc., while saving the draft.</p>



<h3>readDraft</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>export function readDraft(payload) {
 const url = `${API_URL}/${CMS_API_PREFIX}/readDraft.json`;
 return ajax.get(url, { ...payload });
}</code></pre>



<p>This API is used to fetch draft from the API endpoint <strong>readDraft.json</strong>. This API is called on the BotBuilder Page where all the saved drafts are shown.</p>



<h3>deleteDraft</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>export function deleteDraft(payload) {
 const { id } = payload;
 const url = `${API_URL}/${CMS_API_PREFIX}/deleteDraft.json`;
 return ajax.get(url, { id });
}</code></pre>



<p>This API is used to delete the saved Draft from the API endpoint <strong>deleteDraft.json</strong>. It only needs one query parameter i.e. the draft ID.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the above API’s are the backbone of the SUSI.AI Bot Builder. API endpoints in server ensure the user has the same experience across the clients. Do checkout implementation of different API endpoints in server <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/susi_server/tree/development/src/ai/susi/server/api">here</a>. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android">open event attendee</a> android app earlier only access token is used, which causes HTTP 401 many time due to expiry of the token. It needs to re sign-in for the user. Now we have implemented refresh token authorization with the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server">open event server</a> using retrofit and OkHttp. Retrofit is one of the most popular HTTP client for Android. When calling API, we may require authentication using a token. Usually, the token is expired after a certain amount of time and needs to be refreshed using the refresh token. The client would need to send an additional HTTP request in order to get the new token. Imagine you have a collection of many different APIs, each of them requires token authentication. If you have to handle refresh token by modifying your code one by one, it will take a lot of time and of course, it&#8217;s not a good solution. In this blog, I&#8217;m going to show you how to handle refresh token on each API calls automatically if the token expires.<br></p>



<ul><li>How refresh token works?</li><li>Add authenticator to OkHttp</li><li>Network call and handle response</li><li>Conclusion</li><li>Resources&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Let’s analyze every step in detail.<br></p>



<h2>How Refresh Token Works?</h2>



<p>Whether tokens are opaque or not is usually defined by the implementation. Common implementations allow for direct authorization checks against an access token. That is, when an access token is passed to a server managing a resource, the server can read the information contained in the token and decide itself whether the user is authorized or not (no checks against an authorization server are needed). This is one of the reasons tokens must be signed (using JWS, for instance). On the other hand, refresh tokens usually require a check against the authorization server.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Add Authenticator to OkHTTP</h2>



<p>OkHttp will automatically ask the Authenticator for credentials when a response is 401 Not Authorised retrying last failed request with them.</p>

        <span class="hljs-comment">// Add new header to rejected request and retry it</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">return</span> response.request().newBuilder()
            .header(AUTHORIZATION, newAccessToken)
            .build()
    }
}</pre>



<p>Add the authenticatior to OkHttp:</p>



<pre class="hljs" style="padding: 0.5em"><span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">val</span> builder = OkHttpClient().newBuilder()
            .authenticator(TokenAuthenticator())</pre>



<h2>Network Call and Handle Response</h2>



<p>API call with retrofit:</p>



<pre class="hljs" style="padding: 0.5em"><span class="hljs-meta">@POST(<span class="hljs-meta-string">"/auth/token/refresh"</span>)</span>
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">fun</span> <span class="hljs-title" style="font-weight: 700">refreshToken</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>: Single&lt;RefreshResponse&gt;</pre>



<p>Refresh Response:</p>



<pre class="hljs" style="padding: 0.5em"><span class="hljs-meta">@JsonNaming(PropertyNamingStrategy.SnakeCaseStrategy::class)</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">data</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">class</span> <span class="hljs-title" style="font-weight: 700">RefreshResponse</span></span>(
    <span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">val</span> refreshToken: String
)</pre>



<h2>In a Nutshell</h2>



<p>Refresh tokens improve security and allow for reduced latency and better access patterns to authorization servers. Implementations can be simple using tools such as JWT + JWS. If you are interested in learning more about tokens (and cookies), check our article here.</p>

<p>The implementation of event invoice tables is already explained in the blog post <a href="https://blog.fossasia.org/implementation-of-event-invoice-view-using-ember-tables/">Implementation of Event Invoice view using Ember Tables</a>. This blog post is an extension which will showcase the implementation of paid route for event invoice in<a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend"> Open Event Frontend</a>. Event invoices can be explained as the monthly fee given by the organizer to the platform for hosting their event.</p>



<p>We begin by defining a route for displaying the paid event invoice. We chose <strong>event-invoice/paid</strong> route in <em>router.js</em></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>this</strong>.route('event-invoice', <strong>function</strong>() {
   ...
   <strong>this</strong>.route('paid', { path: '/:invoice_identifier/paid' });
 });</pre>



<p>Now, we need to finalize the <em>paid</em> route. The route is divided in three sections &#8211;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><em>titleToken</em><em> </em>:&nbsp; To display title in the tab of the browser.</li><li><em>model</em><em> </em>:&nbsp; To fetch event-invoice with the given identifier.</li><li><em>afterModel</em><em> </em>: To check if the status of the fetched event -invoice is <em>paid</em> or <em>due</em>. If it is due, it is redirected to review page otherwise it is redirected to paid page.</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>import</strong> Route from '@ember/routing/route';
 
export <strong>default</strong> <strong>class</strong> <strong>extends</strong> <strong>Route</strong> {
 
 titleToken(model) {
   <strong>return</strong> <strong>this</strong>.l10n.tVar(`Paid Event Invoice - ${model.get('identifier')}`);
 }
 
 model(params) {
   <strong>return</strong> <strong>this</strong>.store.findRecord('event-invoice', params.invoice_identifier, 
     {
         include : 'event,user',
         reload  : true
     }
   );
 }
 
 afterModel(model) {
   <strong>if</strong> (model.get('status') === 'due') {
     <strong>this</strong>.transitionTo('event-invoice.review', model.get('identifier'));
   } <strong>else</strong> <strong>if</strong> (model.get('status') === 'paid') {
     <strong>this</strong>.transitionTo('event-invoice.paid', model.get('identifier'));
   }
 }
}</pre>



<p>Now, we need to design the template for paid route. It includes various elements &#8211;</p>



<ol><li><strong>Invoice Summary</strong> :&nbsp;</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/321g0gW2YZwBuHK6QB6_nOS9sBwmE2mBfaXTji0_kZopoennv21JKEj5WHvsPEc3o8GI6deju2YBIaWQUQI7iHMrGC2jqX3ej3vIB7fqyL1GG2QXW08PIV6HFpLIFTBi9hXgq2FJ" alt="" /></figure>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;<strong>div</strong> class="ten wide column print"&gt;      
    {{event-invoice/invoice-summary data=model                             
        event=model.event                               
        eventCurrency=model.event.paymentCurrency}} 
&lt;/<strong>div</strong>&gt;</pre>



<p>The invoice summary contains some of the details of the event invoice. It contains the event name, date of issue, date of completion and amount payable of the event invoice. The snippet for invoice summary can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend/blob/development/app/templates/components/event-invoice/billing-info.hbs">here</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp; <strong>Event Info</strong><strong><em> </em></strong>:<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dbo4rO4NxopZxRCWQMKFYJs-pTob7Qz2DjetBinLPJApq9tc2L6YpzpjlkEIFnCW1e9R3_YaUwkLjalgcJsmSLRmMJJrsO6_1H5_r69y3EJkAEXBAbprY5thiN_WEg1wD1JvencV" alt="" /></figure>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;<strong>div</strong> class="mobile hidden six wide column"&gt;
  {{event-invoice/event-info event=model.event}}
&lt;/<strong>div</strong>&gt;</pre>



<p>The event info section of the paid page contains the description of the event to which the invoice is associated. It contains event location, start date and end date of the event. The snippet for event info can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend/blob/development/app/templates/components/event-invoice/event-info.hbs">here</a></p>

&lt;/<strong>div</strong>&gt;</pre>



<p>The billing info section of the event invoice paid page contains the billing info of the user to which the event is associated and that of the admin. The billing info includes name, email, phone, zip code and country of the user and the admin. The snippet for billing info can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend/blob/development/app/templates/components/event-invoice/billing-info.hbs">here</a></p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;<strong>div</strong> class="mobile hidden row"&gt;
   {{event-invoice/payee-info data=model payer=model.user}}
&lt;/<strong>div</strong>&gt;</pre>



<p>The payee information displays the name and email of the user who pays for the invoice and also the method of the payment along with relevant information. The snippet for payee info can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend/blob/development/app/templates/components/event-invoice/payee-info.hbs">here</a></p>



<p>We can download the invoice of the payment made for the event invoice. This is triggered when the <em>Print Invoice</em> button is clicked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Code snippet to trigger the download of the invoice &#8211; </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"> &lt;<strong>div</strong> class="row"&gt;

        {{t 'Print Invoice'}}
     &lt;/<strong>button</strong>&gt;
   &lt;/<strong>div</strong>&gt;
 &lt;/<strong>div</strong>&gt;</pre>



<p>The function <em>downloadEventInvoice</em> is called when the button <em>Print Invoice</em> is clicked. The event name and order ID is passed as parameters to the function. When the invoice pdf generation is successful, message <em>Here is your Event Invoice</em> is displayed on the screen whereas if there is an error, the message <em>Unexpected error occurred</em> is displayed.</p>

<p><a href="https://susi.ai/">SUSI.AI</a> now has a chat bubble on the bottom right of every page to assist you. Chat Bubble allows you to connect with susi.ai on just a click. You can now directly play test examples of skill on chatbot. It can also be viewed on full screen mode.</p>



<h2>Redux Code</h2>



<p>Redux Action associated with chat bubble is <strong>handleChatBubble.</strong> Redux state <strong>chatBubble</strong> can have 3 states:</p>



<ul><li><strong>minimised</strong> &#8211; chat bubble is not visible. This set state is set when the chat is viewed in full screen mode.</li><li><strong>bubble </strong>&#8211; only the chat bubble is visible. This state is set when close icon is clicked and on toggle.</li><li><strong>full</strong> &#8211; the chat bubble along with message section is visible. This state is set when minimize icon is clicked on full screen mode and on toggle.</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">const defaultState = {
chatBubble: 'bubble',
};
export default handleActions(
 {
  [actionTypes.HANDLE_CHAT_BUBBLE](state, { payload }) {
     return {
       ...state,
       chatBubble: payload.chatBubble,
     };
   },
 },
 defaultState,
);</pre>



<h3>Speech box for skill example</h3>



<p>The user can click on the speech box for skill example and immediately view the answer for the skill on the chatbot. When a speech bubble is clicked a query parameter <strong>testExample</strong> is added to the URL. The value of this query parameter is resolved and answered by Message Composer. To be able to generate an answer bubble again and again for the same query, we have a reducer state <strong>testSkillExampleKey </strong>which is updated when the user clicks on the speech box. This is passed as key parameter to messageSection.</p>



<h3>Chat Bubble Code</h3>



<p>The functions involved in the working of chatBubble code are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>openFullScreen </strong>&#8211; This function is called when the full screen icon is clicked in the tab and laptop view and also when chat bubble is clicked in mobile view. This opens up a full screen dialog with message section. It dispatches handleChatBubble action which sets the chatBubble reducer state as minimised.</li><li><strong>closeFullScreen </strong>&#8211; This function is called when the exit full screen icon is clicked. It dispatches a handleChatBubble action which sets the chatBubble reducer state as full.</li><li><strong>toggleChat </strong>&#8211;&nbsp; This function is called when the user clicks on the chat bubble. It dispatches handleChatBubble action which toggles the chatBubble reducer state between full and bubble.</li><li><strong>handleClose </strong>&#8211; This function is called when the user clicks on the close icon. It dispatches handleChatBubble action which sets the chatBubble reducer state to bubble.</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">openFullScreen = () =&gt; {
   const { actions } = this.props;
   actions.handleChatBubble({
     chatBubble: 'minimised',
   });
   actions.openModal({
     modalType: 'chatBubble',
     fullScreenChat: true,
   });
 };

 closeFullScreen = () =&gt; {
   const { actions } = this.props;
   actions.handleChatBubble({
     chatBubble: 'full',
   });
   actions.closeModal();
 };

 toggleChat = () =&gt; {
   const { actions, chatBubble } = this.props;
   actions.handleChatBubble({
     chatBubble: chatBubble === 'bubble' ? 'full' : 'bubble',
   });
 };

 handleClose = () =&gt; {
   const { actions } = this.props;
   actions.handleChatBubble({ chatBubble: 'bubble' });
   actions.closeModal();
 };</pre>



<h3>Message Section Code (Reduced)</h3>



<p>The message section comprises of three parts the actionBar, messageSection and the message Composer. </p>



<h4>Action Bar</h4>



<p>The actionBar consists of the action buttons &#8211; search, full screen, exit full screen and close button. Clicking on the search button expands and opens up a search bar. On clicking the full screen icon openFullScreen function is called which open up the chat dialog. On clicking the exit icon the handleClose function is called, which set chatBubble reducer state to bubble. On full screen view, clicking on the exit full screen icon calls the closeFullScreen functions which sets the reducer state chatBubble to full.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>   const actionBar = (
     &lt;ActionBar fullScreenChat={fullScreenChat}&gt;
       {fullScreenChat !== undefined ? (
         &lt;FullScreenExit onClick={this.closeFullScreen} width={width} /&gt;
       ) : (
         &lt;FullScreen onClick={this.openFullScreen} width={width} /&gt;
       )}
       &lt;Close onClick={fullScreenChat ? this.handleClose : this.toggleChat}/&gt;
     &lt;/ActionBar&gt;
   );</code></pre>



<h4>Message Section</h4>



<p>The message section has two parts MessageList and Message Composer. Message List is where the messages are viewed and the Message composer allows you to interact with the bot through text and speech. ScrollBar is imported from the npm library react-custom-scrollbars. When the scroll bar is moved it sets the state of showScrollTop and showScrollBottom in the chat. messageListItems consists of all the messages between the user and the bot.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>
   const messageSection = (
     &lt;MessageSectionContainer showChatBubble={showChatBubble} height={height}&gt;

<p>In the previous versions of the firmware for the smart speaker, we had a separate flask server for serving the configuration page and another flask server for serving the control page. This puts forward inconsistencies in the frontend. To make the frontend and the user experience the same across all platforms, the SUSI.AI Web Client is now integrated into the smart speaker. <br><br>Now whenever the device is in Access Point mode (Setup mode), and the user accesses the web client running on the smart speaker, the device configuration page is shown.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/u8mFSQpGAVjD8FyMzVaI8hGApyPtlLpyC-WXssEPInzAfxvtKHG1P4NMema1bBS0RCOFzDwnMtJUH3SmRV63kIXK--SLNLyQNI4l6Q7jgXAAlETAx091kzLZxDCu2zbr27Uz1ZbZ" alt="" /></figure>



<p>If the device is not in access point mode, the normal Web Client is shown with a green bar on top saying “You are currently accessing the local version of your SUSI.AI running on your smart device. Configure now”<br>Clicking on the Configure now link redirects the user to the control page, where the user can change the settings for their smart speaker and control media playback.</p>



<p><br>To integrate both the control web page and the configure web page in the web client we needed to combine the flask server for the control and the configure page. This is done by adding all the endpoints of the configure server to the sound server and then renaming the sound server to control server &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/susi_installer/pull/75/files">Merge Servers<br><br></a></p>



<h2>Serving the WebClient through the control server</h2>



<p><br>The next step is to add the Web Client static code to the control server and make it available on the root URL of the server.<br>To do this, first, we have to clone the web client during the installation and add the required symbolic links for the server.</p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><code>echo "Downloading: Susi.AI webclient"<br>if [ ! -d "susi.ai" ]<br>then<br>    git clone --depth 1 -b gh-pages https://github.com/fossasia/susi.ai.git<br>    ln -s $PWD/susi.ai/static/* $PWD/susi_installer/raspi/soundserver/static/<br>    ln -s $PWD/susi.ai/index.html $PWD/susi_installer/raspi/soundserver/templates/<br>else<br>    echo "WARNING: susi.ai directory already present, not cloning it!" &gt;&amp;2<br>fi</code></td></tr></tbody></table>



<p><br>The next step is to add the route for the Web Client in the control flask server.<br><br><br></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><code>@app.route('/')<br>def index():<br>    return render_template('index.html')</code></td></tr></tbody></table>



<p><br>Here the index.html file is of the Web Client which we linked to the templates folder in the previous step.<br><br></p>



<h2><br>Connecting the web client to the locally running SUSI Server</h2>



<p><br>The Web Client by default connects to the SUSI Server at <a href="https://api.susi.ai">https://api.susi.ai</a> but however the smart speaker has its own server running. To connect to the local server we do the following<br></p>



<p>&#8211; Before building the local version from the source of web client we need to set the process.env.REACT_APP_LOCAL_ENV environment variable to true.</p>



<p>&#8211; While building the javascript function check() checks if the above-mentioned environment variable is set to true and if yes, sets the API_URL to http://&lt;host_IP_address&gt;:4000</p>



<p></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><code>function check() {<br>  if (process &amp;&amp; process.env.REACT_APP_LOCAL_ENV === 'true') {<br>    return 'http://' + window.location.hostname + ':4000';<br>  }<br>  return 'https://api.susi.ai';<br>}<br><br>const urls = {<br>  API_URL: check(),<br>  .  .//rest URLs <br>};</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>In this blog post we will talk about the software architecture that we have followed in PSLab Desktop. We will discuss in detail about how the three components, ie &#8211; Electron, React and Python gel together in our architecture and give the user a smooth, high performance, cross platform experience.</p>



<p>The picture below is all there is to the PSLab Desktop architecture. I have numbered all the main components and will break them down in later section of the article. Once you get this architecture going on in the back of your head while writing the app, you would be able to think clearly and code more efficiently.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/loimTi0B4Y2OkpWEY0WIBnvDggoU0dyGxBhg716BGB2DGAZ4BBpiTNOjqiCSfmERUw5c1bfBUOpyJADR7BX1C-zQjVyG7LF0lZhIsaa-E-WFotji2B87WaElgd0rVPyUCa2wQh65" alt="" /><figcaption><br>An overview of the whole architecture</figcaption></figure>



<p>I am sure there are many other approaches available to build an electron app, but for the stack I used, this architecture turned out to be the only working model that went all the way from development to production and proved its stability after a lot of experimentation.</p>



<p>The PSLab Desktop happens to be a software interface that needs to interact and fetch data from an actual hardware device at a very fast rate and display the results in real time. The stability of this architecture has been tested under various use cases of the PSLab Desktop.<br></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<h3><strong>Let’s break it down</strong></h3>



<p>There are 4 major parts in the whole architecture, let us talk about them one by one.</p>



<h4><strong>1. Main Process</strong></h4>



<p>If you read the documentation of electron, it states that the purpose of the main process is to <strong>create </strong>and<strong> manage </strong>browser windows. Each browser window can then run its own Web page/GUI. As this process is kind of central to managing the whole app, there can be just <strong>one and only one</strong> main process throughout an electron app life cycle.</p>



<p>The main process has a secondary yet important task of communicating with the OS to make use of <strong>native GUI features</strong> like <em>notifications, </em>creating shortcuts, responding to auto-updates and so on.</p>



<p>It also plays a key role in communication, acting as the middle man for all the browser windows it has created. This is in fact the backbone of the whole architecture we are relying on.</p>



<h4><strong>2. Renderer Process (Visible)</strong></h4>



<p>Every browser window that the main process creates gives rise to a renderer process. For the sake of simplicity, let us call each browser window to be equivalent to a renderer process. The only purpose of a renderer process is to show a webpage. In other words, its task is to render the GUI.</p>



<p>It is also important to note that each browser window that the main process generates runs independently much like tabs on our browser. Even if a tab crashes, the rest of the tabs keep running. This very fundamental feature gives us limitless powers to create stuff.</p>



<p>Q1. Can I make use of native OS features directly from renderer process?</p>



<p>No, you cannot. This is due to security reasons and thus to make use of native OS features, every render process has to communicate with the main process and as it to get the job done on its behalf.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> Actually you can access the main process features directly from renderer process by something called the<a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/remote"> <strong>remote</strong></a> module but that is not considered a healthy practice as a careless code may end up leaking resources.</p>



<p>Everything that you need to know about <strong>main</strong> and <strong>renderer</strong> process has been mentioned in the electron<a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/application-architecture"> documentation</a>.</p>



<p>You may have noticed that I have written the word <strong>visible </strong>separately for the renderer process. Why is that? Because, this is the only renderer that will be visible. As we have mentioned before, we are using <strong>React </strong>as one of our tech stack elements which is a great tool for writing <strong>Single Page Applications</strong>. And as you may have guessed, unlike old web apps, Single page Application do not need to open several tabs, rather, it is like a mobile app that gives the user a smooth experience on a single screen/tab. Thus, we will only need one tab to actually render the whole UI for the app. One tab equals one renderer process.</p>



<h4><strong>3. Renderer Process (Hidden)</strong></h4>



<p><em>But you just said that we only need one renderer process!!</em></p>



<p>Well I said only one <strong>visible</strong> process. Now if you were to make a simple GUI focused app, chances are you’ll never need point number 3 but we are here to push the electron app to new limits.</p>



<p>What happens when you want to perform a <strong>thread blocking</strong> ( heavy computation ) task? Where would you like to perform it? Main process? Nope, your app will crash if you block the main process. Visible renderer process? Nope, your GUI will start to lag and choke. So where do you do it? Yup, you guessed it, this is where the hidden renderer process comes in.</p>



<p>The hidden process is just another tab/window that is inherently hidden from the user. This is because our goal is not to render a UI in it but to perform a thread blocking task. The idea is to create and destroy hidden windows as and when needed in order to do heavy lifting in the background. Thus to do a thread blocking task, you would simply create a hidden window, finish the task in that hidden window ( running in the background ) without causing any issues with the visible components of your app and when you are done, just destroy the hidden window to claim back your resources. It is that simple.</p>



<p>The best part is you can create as many as you want.</p>



<p>This is the<a href="https://medium.com/cameron-nokes/deep-dive-into-electrons-main-and-renderer-processes-7a9599d5c9e2"> article</a> I read to decide upon the approach I would adopt to tackle CPU intensive background tasks. It would be an interesting read if you want to compare this approach to the other options I had.</p>



<h4><strong>4. Python Script</strong></h4>



<p>By now you already know that Python is one of the key elements of our teach stack so we have to find a way to make it work effortlessly with the electron code. So the simplest way to do this was making use of an npm module called<a href="https://github.com/extrabacon/python-shell"> python-shell</a>. This allows us to execute external python scripts from nodeJS application. As you are allowed to use nodeJS features in an electron app, thus the npm modules will work well in your electron code too.</p>



<p>Q1. From where do you call it?</p>



<p>ans. Obviously if you are using python for performing some task, you are planning to do some heavy lifting. But heavy lifting or not, the ideal spot to run the python script is from hidden renderer processes.</p>



<p>It is important to note that the script is not running inside your electron app, rather running in parallel. This diagram should help you visualize it better.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MPda8QbzKgU6eqB3HhkAh4kWtQ-r9g84QKIxx1pG_Zr61uMZkgXf4lnEcHDyIdBxUVNJ8bzbXpRASpDbkXByJlKANamJZqt8i28CWsjbFgVJB89rvPI9bNkutOnrrmGAWh6-Wf--" alt="" /><figcaption><br>Script initialization using render process<br><br></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now obviously your python script may need some input and will most certainly generate some output when it runs. So as the script runs outside your app, you cannot directly grab or send data to the script. But python-shell has a nice feature which can be used to deal with this situation. We will talk about it in the next section.</p>



<p>The way you would design the script itself is again a topic for discussion which will be covered as we go into the details of coding.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Communications</strong></h3>



<p>An important point of discussion is how will each of these four components talk to each other. And to be frank, we just need to take care of three types of communication in our app.</p>



<h4><strong>1. Main — Renderer :</strong></h4>



<p>The actual means of communication is called the <strong>electron IPC (Inter Process Communication). </strong>The renderer processes use the<a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-renderer"> <em>ipcRenderer</em></a> while the main process uses the<a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-main"> <em>ipcMain</em></a>.</p>



<p>Now if you were to ask how it actually looks like then the best analogy is <strong>event listeners. </strong>You just set up a bunch of listeners on both ends depending on what you plan to listen for. Later on in the app life cycle, you can trigger these listeners manually to get the desired output.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1P5VI1C6kWUbScq9uzBhHETx8Q7ITay2WyE1h1WV210m4cbbQyAygxoPnBxF7Lq6kf8iQXI6h0usJHK6_8qE5tRzfR5o3JfVDuYVJgE0jN1GK1v59EBJ_PImDQ4HTnsb8rt7p3BB" alt="" /><figcaption><br>Placing listeners on Main and render threads for bouncing messages<br></figcaption></figure>



<p>This idea can be extended to any number of render and main process combination. Under the hood, this is all there is.</p>



<h4><strong>2. Visible Renderer— Hidden Renderer :</strong></h4>



<p>There is <strong>no direct means</strong> of communication between two renderer processes. So the hidden renderer process cannot directly talk to the visible renderer process. The only way to actually establish a communication is by bouncing messages off the main process much like a relay system.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/e0Ot7otlhe383c-H3eu-eDhO8AJKrttD4Czs1w5SiXFQJwwY6V5HlTzi_odX8683qEXy6ZSpmDFWEUzGEWEC0GCbRVK6mQYRTfztompbAzl1y3Dx84XxWhfP66mTL92ntG1ygifi" alt="" /><figcaption><br>Hidden render &#8211; Visible render process communication</figcaption></figure>



<h4><strong>3. Hidden Renderer — Python Script :</strong></h4>



<p>The python-shell library provides us a way to make use of <strong>stdin</strong> and <strong>stdout</strong> channels for sending and receiving data from the python script.</p>



<p>So the best way to write your python code would be to assume that you would be using it from the terminal where you directly read data from user input and print data out to the terminal using simple print statement.</p>



<p>The message <em>format</em> that we will be using is <strong>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) </strong>although many other options are available.<strong> </strong>JSON actually makes it easier to structure data which in turn makes it really easy to extract data on both ends with very minimal overhead.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ycJW8v7-regd6XndXU2ODcEaOrYOFn9yVHvPrC6YzMjZNKVa9gMdMkNqY8LVcpG2bpvggTtyzR42t4oiqt_sXpI4pdiyh04W9ZawRCHTK1mffKdySXl0wtciAjR88DRsnW3R8dic" alt="" /><figcaption><br>Script-Hidden render communication</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that I have mentioned that this is the message format I use; don’t end up relating this to HTTP request-response because the term JSON is used quite heavily in that domain.<br></p>

<h3></h3>



<p>This blog post will showcase introduction of new <em>owner </em>role for users in<a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend"> Open Event Frontend</a>. Now a user associated with organizing of an event can have any of the following roles:</p>



<ol><li>Owner</li><li>Organizer</li><li>Co-organizer</li><li>Track-organizer</li><li>Moderator</li><li>Registrar</li></ol>



<p>Till now, the user creating the event had <em>organizer </em>role which was not exclusive. An organizer can invite other users to be organizer. So, later we couldn’t give exclusive rights to the event creator due to this.</p>



<p>But there can only be a single owner of an event. So, the introduction of new <em>owner </em>role will help us distinguish the owner and give him/her exclusive rights for the event.<br>This refactor involved a lot of changes. Let’s go step by step:</p>



<ul><li>I updated the role of the user creating the event to be <em>owner </em>by default. For this, we query the user and owner role and use it to create a new <em>UserEventRoles</em> object and save it to database. Then we create a role invite object using the user email, role title, event id and role id.</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>def</strong> <strong>after_create_object</strong>(self, event, data, view_kwargs):
  ...
       user = User.query.filter_by(id=view_kwargs['user_id']).first()
       role = Role.query.filter_by(name=OWNER).first()
       uer = UsersEventsRoles(user, event, role)
       save_to_db(uer, 'Event Saved')
       role_invite = RoleInvite(user.email, role.title_name, event.id,
                     role.id, datetime.now(pytz.utc), status='accepted')
       save_to_db(role_invite, 'Owner Role Invite Added')</pre>



<ul><li>We included a new function <em>is_owner</em> to <em>permission_manager </em>helper which checks if the <em>current_user</em> is owner of the event passed in <em>kwargs</em>. If the user is not the owner, <em>ForbiddenError</em> is returned.</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">@jwt_required
<strong>def</strong> <strong>is_owner</strong>(view, view_args, view_kwargs, *args, **kwargs):
   user = current_user
   <strong>if</strong> user.is_staff:
       <strong>return</strong> view(*view_args, **view_kwargs)
   <strong>if</strong> <strong>not</strong> user.is_owner(kwargs['event_id']):
       <strong>return</strong> ForbiddenError({'source': ''}, 'Owner access is required').respond()
   <strong>return</strong> view(*view_args, **view_kwargs)</pre>



<ul><li>Updated event schema to add new owner fields and relationship. We updated the fields &#8211;</li></ul>



<ol><li><em>organizer_name &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;   owner_name</em></li><li><em>has_organizer_info&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;   has_owner_info</em></li><li><em>organizer_description&nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;   owner_description</em></li></ol>



<p><em>     </em>We also included <em>owner</em> relationship in the EventSchemaPublic</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">@use_defaults()
<strong>class</strong> <strong>EventSchemaPublic</strong>(SoftDeletionSchema):
   ...
   owner_name = fields.Str(allow_none=<strong>True</strong>)
   has_owner_info = fields.Bool(default=<strong>False</strong>)
   owner_description = fields.Str(allow_none=<strong>True</strong>)

   ...
   owner = Relationship(attribute='owner',
                        self_view='v1.event_owner',
                        self_view_kwargs={'id': '&lt;id&gt;'},
                        related_view='v1.user_detail',
                        schema='UserSchemaPublic',
                        related_view_kwargs={'event_id': '&lt;id&gt;'},
                        type_='user')
</pre>



<ul><li>To accommodate the introduction of owner role, we have to introduce a new boolean field <em>is_user_owner </em>and a new relationship <em>owner_events</em> to the UserSchema. The relationship <em>owner_events </em>can be used to fetch lit of events of which a given user is the owner.</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>class</strong> <strong>UserSchema</strong>(UserSchemaPublic):
   ...
   is_user_owner = fields.Boolean(dump_only=<strong>True</strong>)
   ...
   owner_events = Relationship(
       self_view='v1.user_owner_event',
       self_view_kwargs={'id': '&lt;id&gt;'},
       related_view='v1.event_list',
       schema='EventSchema',
       many=<strong>True</strong>,
       type_='event')</pre>



<ul><li>Similarly, we need to update Event model too. A new <em>owner</em> relationship is introduced to the event model which is related to User. It basically stores the owner of the event.<br>We then introduce a new function <em>get_owner( )</em> to the model which iterates through all the roles and return the user if the role is the owner.</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>class</strong> <strong>Event</strong>(SoftDeletionModel):
   ...
   owner = db.relationship('User',
             viewonly=<strong>True</strong>,
             secondary='join(UsersEventsRoles, Role, and_(Role.id ==
                        UsersEventsRoles.role_id, Role.name == "owner"))',
             primaryjoin='UsersEventsRoles.event_id == Event.id',
             secondaryjoin='User.id == UsersEventsRoles.user_id',
             backref='owner_events',
             uselist=<strong>False</strong>)</pre>

<p>Devices tab displays device name, macId, room, email Id, date added, last active, last login IP and location of the device. <strong>loadDevices</strong> function is called on<strong> componentDidMount</strong> which calls the <strong>fetchDevices</strong> API which fetches the list of devices from <strong>/aaa/getDeviceList.json </strong>endpoint. List of all devices is stored in <strong>devices</strong> array. Each device in the array is an object with the above properties. Clicking on the device location opens a popup displaying the device location on the map.</p>

<p>View action redirects to users <strong>/mydevices?email&lt;email&gt;&amp;macid=&lt;macid&gt;</strong>. This allows admin to have full control of the My devices section of the user. Admin can change device details and delete device. Also admin can see all the devices of the user from the ALL tab. To edit a device click on edit icon in the table, update the details and click on check icon. To delete a device click on the delete device which then asks for confirmation of device name and on confirmation deletes the device.</p>

<p>Delete action opens up a confirm delete dialog modal. To delete a device enter the device name and click on delete. This calls the <strong>confirmDelete </strong>function which calls the <strong>removeUserDevice </strong>API which takes in email Id and macId as parameters. This API hits the endpoint <strong>/aaa/removeUserDevices.json.</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">confirmDelete = () =&gt; {
   const { actions } = this.props;
   const { macId, email } = this.state;
   removeUserDevice({ macId, email })
     .then(payload =&gt; {
       actions.openSnackBar({
         snackBarMessage: payload.message,
         snackBarDuration: 2000,
       });
       actions.closeModal();
       this.setState({
         loadingDevices: true,
       });
       this.loadDevices();
     })
     .catch(error =&gt; {
       actions.openSnackBar({
         snackBarMessage: `Unable to delete device with macID ${macId}. Please try again.`,
         snackBarDuration: 2000,
       });
     });
 };</pre>



<p>To conclude, admin can now view all the connected SUSI.AI devices along with the user details and location. They can also access users My Devices tab in Dashboard and update and delete devices.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android">open event attendee</a> is an android app which allows users to discover events happening around the world using the Open Event Platform. It consumes the APIs of the open event server to get a list of available events and can get detailed information about them.<br></p>



<p>Shimmer effect was created by Facebook to indicate a loading status, so instead of using ProgressBar or the usual loader use Shimmer for a better design and user interface. They also open-sourced a library called Shimmer both for Android and iOS so that every developer could use it for free.<br></p>



<ul><li>Add Shimmer library</li><li>Create a placeholder for shimmer</li><li>Apply the effect with live data</li><li>Conclusion</li><li>Resources</li></ul>



<p>Let’s analyze every step in detail.</p>



<h2>Add Shimmer Library&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Add Shimmer Library to build.gradle :</p>

<span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">implementation</span> <span class="hljs-string">'com.facebook.shimmer:shimmer:0.5.0'</span></pre>



<h2>Create reasouces</h2>



<p>Add shimmer background color to colors.xml:</p>



<pre class="hljs" style="padding: 0.5em">&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">color</span> <span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"shimmer_background"</span>&gt;#dddddd&lt;/<span class="hljs-built_in">color</span>&gt;</pre>



<p>Create a placeholder layout:</p>

<p>The <strong>ListPrivateSkillService </strong>and <strong>ListPrivateDraftSkillService </strong>endpoint was implemented on <a href="https://api.susi.ai/">SUSI.AI Server</a> for <a href="https://susi.ai/">SUSI.AI</a> Admins to view the bots and drafts created by users respectively. This allows admins to monitor the bots and drafts created by users, and delete the ones which violate the guidelines. Also admins can see the sites where the bot is being used.</p>



<p>The endpoint of both <strong>ListPrivateSkillService </strong>and<strong> ListPrivateDraftSkillService </strong>is of <strong>GET</strong> type. Both of them have a compulsory <strong>access_token</strong> parameter but <strong>ListPrivateSkillService </strong>has an extra optional <strong>search </strong>parameter.</p>



<ul><li><strong>access_token</strong>(necessary): It is the <strong>access_token</strong> of the logged in user. It means this endpoint cannot be accessed in anonymous mode.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>search</strong>: It fetches a bot with the searched name.</li></ul>



<p>The minimum user role is set to <strong>OPERATOR</strong>.</p>



<h2>API Development</h2>



<h3>ListPrivateSkillService</h3>



<p>For creating a list, we need to access each property of <strong>botDetailsObject</strong>, in the following manner:</p>



<p>Key → Group  → Language  → Bot Name  → BotList</p>



<p>The below code iterates over the <strong>uuid</strong> of all the users having a bot, then over different <strong>groupNames,languageNames, </strong>and finally over the <strong>botNames.</strong> If search parameter is passed then it searches for the <strong>bot_name</strong> in the language object. Each <strong>botDetails</strong> object consists of bot <strong>name</strong>, <strong>language</strong>, <strong>group</strong> and <strong>key </strong>i.e uuid of the user which is then added to the <strong>botList</strong> array.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">       JsonTray chatbot = DAO.chatbot;
       JSONObject botDetailsObject = chatbot.toJSON();
       JSONObject keysObject = new JSONObject();
       JSONObject groupObject = new JSONObject();
       JSONObject languageObject = new JSONObject();
       List botList = new ArrayList();
       JSONObject result = new JSONObject();

       Iterator Key = botDetailsObject.keys();
       List keysList = new ArrayList();

       while (Key.hasNext()) {
           String key = (String) Key.next();
           keysList.add(key);
       }

       for (String key_name : keysList) {
           keysObject = botDetailsObject.getJSONObject(key_name);
           Iterator groupNames = keysObject.keys();
           List groupnameKeysList = new ArrayList();

           while (groupNames.hasNext()) {
               String key = (String) groupNames.next();
               groupnameKeysList.add(key);
           }

           for (String group_name : groupnameKeysList) {
               groupObject = keysObject.getJSONObject(group_name);
               Iterator languageNames = groupObject.keys();
               List languagenamesKeysList = new ArrayList();

               while (languageNames.hasNext()) {
                   String key = (String) languageNames.next();
                   languagenamesKeysList.add(key);
               }

               for (String language_name : languagenamesKeysList) {
                   languageObject = groupObject.getJSONObject(language_name);</pre>



<p>If <strong>search</strong> parameter is passed, then search for a bot with the given name and add the bot to the <strong>botList </strong>if it exists. It will return all bots which have bot name as the searched name.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">                   if (call.get("search", null) != null) {
                       String bot_name = call.get("search", null);
                       if(languageObject.has(bot_name)){
                           JSONObject botDetails = languageObject.getJSONObject(bot_name);
                           botDetails.put("name", bot_name);
                           botDetails.put("language", language_name);
                           botDetails.put("group", group_name);
                           botDetails.put("key", key_name);
                           botList.add(botDetails);
                       }
                   }</pre>



<p>If search parameter is not passed, then it will return all the bots created by the users.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">                    else {
                       Iterator botNames = languageObject.keys();
                       List botnamesKeysList = new ArrayList();

                       while (botNames.hasNext()) {
                           String key = (String) botNames.next();
                           botnamesKeysList.add(key);
                       }

                       for (String bot_name : botnamesKeysList) {
                           JSONObject botDetails = languageObject.getJSONObject(bot_name);
                           botDetails.put("name", bot_name);
                           botDetails.put("language", language_name);
                           botDetails.put("group", group_name);
                           botDetails.put("key", key_name);
                           botList.add(botDetails);
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }</pre>



<p>List of all bots, <strong>botList </strong>is return as server response.</p>



<h3>ListPrivateDraftSkillService</h3>



<p>For creating a list we need to iterate over each user and check whether the user has a draft bot. We get all the authorized clients from <strong>DAO.getAuthorizedClients(). </strong>We then iterate over each client and get their identity and authorization. We get the drafts of the client from <strong>DAO.readDrafts(userAuthorization.getIdentity()). </strong>We then iterate over each draft and add it to the <strong>drafts </strong>object. Each <strong>draft</strong> object consists of date <strong>created</strong>,date <strong>modified</strong>, <strong>object </strong>which contains draft bot information such as name,language,etc provided by the user while saving the draft,<strong> email</strong> Id and <strong>uuid </strong>of the user.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">       JSONObject result = new JSONObject();
       List draftBotList = new ArrayList();
       Collection authorized = DAO.getAuthorizedClients();

       for (Client client : authorized) {
         String email = client.toString().substring(6);
         JSONObject json = client.toJSON();
         ClientIdentity identity = new ClientIdentity(ClientIdentity.Type.email, client.getName());
         Authorization userAuthorization = DAO.getAuthorization(identity);
         Map map = DAO.readDrafts(userAuthorization.getIdentity());
         JSONObject drafts = new JSONObject();

         for (Map.Entry entry: map.entrySet()) {
           JSONObject val = new JSONObject();
           val.put("object", entry.getValue().getObject());
           val.put("created", DateParser.iso8601Format.format(entry.getValue().getCreated()));
           val.put("modified", DateParser.iso8601Format.format(entry.getValue().getModified()));
           drafts.put(entry.getKey(), val);
         }
         Iterator keys = drafts.keySet().iterator();
         while(keys.hasNext()) {
           String key = (String)keys.next();
           if (drafts.get(key) instanceof JSONObject) {
             JSONObject draft = new JSONObject(drafts.get(key).toString());
             draft.put("id", key);
             draft.put("email", email);
             draftBotList.add(draft);
           }
         }
       }
       result.put("draftBots", draftBotList);</pre>



<p>List of all drafts, <strong>draftBotList </strong>is returned as server response.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the admins can now see the bots and drafts created by the user and monitor where they are being used.</p>

<p>When the SUSI Smart Speaker is set up for the first time it needs to be configured. After successful configuration, the smart speaker is registered with the associated account so that the user can see their smart speaker device information from the settings of their <a href="http://susi.ai">susi.ai</a> account. There are two ways to configure&nbsp; the smart speaker:<br><br></p>



<ul><li>Through the android app</li><li>Through the Web Configuration Page</li></ul>



<p>Both these processes are shown in detail here &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/susi_installer/blob/development/docs/configure_guide.md">https://github.com/fossasia/susi_installer/blob/development/docs/configure_guide.md</a></p>



<p><br>After the configuration setup is done, the Smart Speaker reboots and connects to your WiFi and registers the device with the given account using the login information provided during the setup.<br><br>&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Figure: Device Details are shown in the susi.ai account settings after successful configuration.</p>



<h2>Working</h2>



<h3>The Auth Endpoint</h3>



<p>Whenever the speaker is configured via the android app or manually via the web interface it uses various endpoints (<a href="https://github.com/fossasia/susi_installer/blob/development/raspi/access_point/server/server.py">access-point-server</a>). For storing login information /auth endpoint is used. The /auth endpoint writes the login details to config.json file in /home/pi/SUSI.AI/config.json<br></p>



<p>The ss-susi-register service is then enabled i.e. the service will run in the next startup which will register the device online after the device is connected to the WiFi.</p>



<p></p>

<h3><br>The SYSTEMD Registration Service</h3>



<p>ss-susi-register.service &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/susi_installer/blob/development/raspi/systemd/ss-susi-register.service">https://github.com/fossasia/susi_installer/blob/development/raspi/systemd/ss-susi-register.service</a></p>



<p>This is the service which registers the device on bootup after the configuration phase. The service waits for the network services to run such that the registration script is run only after when it is connected to a network. This service uses register.py to register the device online.<br></p>

<p>This blog post will showcase the introduction of new <em>Initializing </em>status for orders in<a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend"> Open Event Frontend</a>. So, now we have a total of six status. Let’s take a closer look and understand what exactly these order status means:</p>



<table class="wp-block-table has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Status</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td><td><strong>Color Code</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Initializing</td><td>When a user selects tickets and clicks on <em>Order Now </em>button on public event page, the user will get 15 minutes to fill up the order form. The status for order till the form is submitted is &#8211;<strong> initializing</strong></td><td>Yellow</td></tr><tr><td>Placed</td><td>If only offline paid tickets are present in order i.e. paymentMode belongs to one of the following &#8211; bank, cheque, onsite; then the status of order is <strong>placed</strong></td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Pending</td><td>If the order contains online paid tickets, the status for such order is <strong>pending</strong>. User gets 30 minutes to complete payment for such pending orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>If user completes the payment in this timespan of 30 minutes, the status of order is updated to <em>completed.</em>However if user fails to complete payment in 30 minutes, the status of the order is updated to <em>expired.</em></td><td>Orange</td></tr><tr><td>Completed</td><td>There are two cases when the status of order is completed &#8211;<br><strong>1.</strong> If the ordered tickets are free tickets, the status of order is completed.<br><strong>2.</strong> If the online payment for <em>pending</em> tickets is completed in timespan of 30 minutes, the status is updated to <strong>completed.&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Green</td></tr><tr><td>Expired</td><td>There are two cases when status of order is updated to <strong>expired.</strong><br><strong>1.</strong> If the user fails to fill up the order form in the 15 minutes allotted to the user, the status changes from <em>initializing</em> to <strong>expired.</strong><br><strong>2. </strong>If the user fails to complete the payment for online paid orders in timeframe of 30 minutes allotted, the status is updated from <em>pending</em> to <strong>expired.</strong>&nbsp;</td><td>Red</td></tr><tr><td>Cancelled</td><td>When an organizer cancels an order, the order is given status of <strong>cancelled.</strong></td><td>Grey</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>So, basically the status of code is set based on the value of <em>paymentMode </em>attribute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the paymentMode is <em>free</em>, the status is set to <em>completed</em>.<br>If the paymentMode is <em>bank</em> or <em>cheque</em> or <em>onsite, </em>the status is set to <em>placed</em>.<br>Otherwise, the status is set to <em>pending</em>.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>if</strong> (paymentMode === 'free') {
    order.set('status', 'completed');
} <strong>else</strong> <strong>if</strong> (paymentMode === 'bank' || paymentMode ===  'cheque' || paymentMode === 'onsite') {
    order.set('status', 'placed');
} <strong>else</strong> {
    order.set('status', 'pending');
}</pre>



<p>We render the status of order at many places in the frontend, so we introduced a new helper <em>order-color</em> which returns the color code depending on the status of the order.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>import</strong> { helper } <strong>from</strong> '@ember/component/helper';

<strong>export</strong> <strong>function</strong> <strong>orderColor</strong>(params) {
 <strong>switch</strong> (params[0]) {
   <strong>case</strong> 'completed':
     <strong>return</strong> 'green';
   <strong>case</strong> 'placed':
     <strong>return</strong> 'blue';
   <strong>case</strong> 'initializing':
     <strong>return</strong> 'yellow';
   <strong>case</strong> 'pending':
     <strong>return</strong> 'orange';
   <strong>case</strong> 'expired':
     <strong>return</strong> 'red';
   <strong>default</strong>:
     <strong>return</strong> 'grey';
 }
}

<strong>export</strong> <strong>default</strong> helper(orderColor);</pre>



<p>This refactor was followed up on server also to accommodate changes:</p>



<ul><li>Ensuring that the default status is always <em>initializing. </em>For this, we place a condition in <em>before_post </em>hook to mark the <em>status </em>as <em>initializing.</em></li><li>Till now, the email and notification were sent out only for completed orders but as we now use <em>placed</em> status for offline paid orders so we send out email and notification for placed orders too. For this, I updated the condition in <em>after_creat</em>e<em>_object</em> hook</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>class</strong> <strong>OrdersListPost</strong>(ResourceList):
    ...
    <strong>def</strong> <strong>before_post</strong>(self, args, kwargs, data=None):
        ...
        <strong>if</strong> <strong>not</strong> has_access('is_coorganizer', event_id=data['event']):
           data['status'] = 'initializing'

    <strong>def</strong> <strong>after_create_object</strong>(self, order, data, view_kwargs):
       ...
       # send e-mail and notifications if the order status is completed
       <strong>if</strong> order.status == 'completed' <strong>or</strong> order.status ==  'placed':
           # fetch tickets attachment
           order_identifier = order.identifier
       ...</pre>



<ul><li>To ensure that orders with status as <em>initializing</em> and <em>pending</em> are updatable only, we introduced a check in <em>before_update_object </em>hook.</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>class</strong> <strong>OrderDetail</strong>(ResourceDetail):
    ...
    <strong>def</strong> <strong>before_update_object</strong>(self, order, data, view_kwargs):
               ...
        <strong>elif</strong> current_user.id == order.user_id:
           <strong>if</strong> order.status != 'initializing' <strong>and</strong> order.status != 'pending':
               <strong>raise</strong> ForbiddenException({'pointer': ''},  "You cannot update a non-initialized or non-pending order")</pre>



<ul><li>To allow a new status <em>initializing</em> for the orders, we needed to include it as a valid choice for status in order schema.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>class</strong> <strong>OrderSchema</strong>(SoftDeletionSchema):
     ...
     status = fields.Str(
       validate=validate.OneOf(
           choices=["initializing", "pending", "cancelled",
                    "completed", "placed", "expired"]
     ))</pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-organizer-android">Open Event Organizer Android App</a> consists of various features which can be used by event organizers to manage their events. Also, they can invite other people for various roles. After acceptance of the role invite, the particular user would have access to features like the event settings and functionalities like scanning of tickets and editing of event details, depending on the access level of the role.<br></p>



<p>There can be various roles which can be assigned to a user: Organizer, Co-Organizer, Track Organizer, Moderator, Attendee, Registrar.<br></p>



<p>Here we will go through the process of implementing the feature to invite a person for a particular role for an event using that person’s email address.<br></p>



<p>The ‘Add Role’ screen has an email field to enter the invitee’s email address and select the desired role for the person. Upon clicking the ‘Send Invite’ button, the person would be sent a mail containing a link to accept the role invite.<br></p>



<p>The Role class is used for the different types of available roles.<br></p>

<p>Pagination (Endless Scrolling or Infinite Scrolling) breaks down a list of content into smaller parts, loaded one at a time. It is important when the quantity of data to be loaded is huge and loading all the data at once can result in timeout.<br></p>



<p>Here, we will discuss about the implementation of pagination in the list of attendees in the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-organizer-android">Open Event Organizer App (Eventyay Organizer App)</a>.<br></p>



<p>It is an Android app used by event organizers to create and manage events on the Eventyay platform. Features include event creation, ticket management, attendee list with ticket details, scanning of participants etc.<br></p>



<p>In the Open Event Organizer App, the loading of attendees would result in timeout when the number of attendees would be large. The solution for fixing this was the implementation of pagination in the Attendees fragment.<br></p>



<p>First, the API call needs to be modified to include the page size as well as the addition of page number as a Query.<br></p>



<pre style='color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff'><span style='color:#7f9fbf;font-weight:bold'>@GET("events/{id}/attendees?include=order,ticket,event&amp;fields[event]=id&amp;fields[ticket]=id&amp;page[size]=20")</span>
Observable&lt;List&lt;Attendee&gt;&gt; getAttendeesPageWise(<span style='color:#7f9fbf;font-weight:bold'>@Path("id")</span> long id, <span style='color:#7f9fbf;font-weight:bold'>@Query("page[number]")</span> long pageNumber)<span style='color:#308080'>;</span>
</pre>
<!--Created using ToHtml.com on 2019-09-02 14:36:28 UTC -->



<p></p>



<p>Now, we need to modify the logic of fetching the list of attendees to include the page number. Whenever one page ends, the next page should be fetched automatically and added to the list.<br></p>



<p>The page number needs to be passed as an argument in the loadAttendeesPageWise() method in AttendeesViewModel.<br></p>



<pre style='color:#000020;background:#f6f8ff'><span style='color:#200080;font-weight:bold'>public</span> void loadAttendeesPageWise(long pageNumber, boolean forceReload) <span style='color:#406080'>{</span>

<p>This blog post will showcase an option using which a user can delete his/her account in<a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend"> Open Event Frontend</a>. In Open Event we allow a user who is not associated with any event and/or orders to delete his/her own account. User can create a new account with same email later if they want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a 2-step process just to ensure that user doesn’t deletes the account accidentally.</p>



<p>The user needs to get to the <em>Account </em>section where he/she is required to select <em>Danger Zone </em>tab. If user is not associated with any event and/or order, he/she will get an option to delete his/her account along with the following text :</p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><em>All user data will be deleted. Your user data will be entirely erased and any data that will stay in the system for accounting purposes will be anonymized and there will be no link to any of your personal information. Once you delete this account, you will no longer have access to the system</em>.</td></tr></tbody></table>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KYmAoGTHw5pIMYxcvJsqvh-zjTcYRm81KIfnz-N781VS_aTNn8JDJrEXDr56pntXSU_BTBa2vu2zleszGYA02L3Oj13JoSC-fWStL1ppA0XK_C3x60DJOG7WAApyMlFqcnl14oxY" alt="" /><figcaption><em>Option to delete account in Open Event Frontend</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If the user is associated with any event and/or order, the option to delete the account is disabled along with the following text :</p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><em>Your account currently cannot be deleted as active events and/or orders are associated with it. Before you can delete your account you must transfer the ownership of your event(s) to another organizer or cancel your event(s). If you have tickets orders stored in the system, please cancel your orders first too.</em></td></tr></tbody></table>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xSbUUFeOwTBNh9edTgYMxpd5TJZYzAnWjVjWFfWAfvQDG09fKDZkHwQhiAaONgjc3piLxjZoDFuUbpP7h3HOUSmvEaAaIoqHcEBPIMxeiFd8Vd2qOYO3Po77TJ1N7GjF75dYU7XZ" alt="" /><figcaption><em>Disabled option to delete account in Open Event Frontend</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For above toggle we need to check if a user is deletable or not. For that we must check if a user is associated with any event and/or order. The code snippet which checks this is given below :</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">     isUserDeletable: computed('data.events', 
       'data.orders', <strong>function</strong>() {
         <strong>if</strong> (<strong>this</strong>.get('data.events').length || <strong>this</strong>.get('data.orders').length) {
             <strong>return</strong> <strong>false</strong>;
         }
         <strong>return</strong> <strong>true</strong>;
     })</pre>



<p>When a user clicks on the option to delete his/her account, a modal pops up asking the user to confirm his/her email. Once user fills in correct email ID the <em>Proceed</em> button becomes active.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zhAYFXBoVY_Oc0gkhKnXtUaFGA7srxmu1W6uZDNG-tbf6hMF7wXzXA-ARAI-UbBsf6piFYwNiqeKd9rnQ6ZRJ2Z7WRwS7ZqsEnUIjkDCIuXU7ZzBMFcf9MvInUc-k4owU77tsDcw" alt="" /><figcaption><em>Modal to confirm email ID</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The code snippet which triggers the action to open the modal <em>deleteUserModal </em>is given below:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;<strong>button</strong> {{action 'openDeleteUserModal' data.user.id data.user.email}} class='ui red button'&gt;     
    {{t 'Delete Your Account'}} 
&lt;/<strong>button</strong>&gt;</pre>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">   openDeleteUserModal(id, email) {     
     <strong>this</strong>.setProperties({
       'isUserDeleteModalOpen' : <strong>true</strong>,
       'confirmEmail'          : '',
       'userEmail'             : email,
       'userId'                : id
     });
   }</pre>



<p>The code snippet which deals with the email confirmation:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">isEmailDifferent : computed('confirmEmail', function() {
   <strong>return</strong> <strong>this</strong>.userEmail ? <strong>this</strong>.confirmEmail !== <strong>this</strong>.userEmail : <strong>true</strong>;
 })</pre>



<p>When user confirms his/her email and hits <em>Proceed </em>button, a new modal appears which asks the user to confirm his/her action to delete account.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XcpwqftiTW9Zfh3Fp7CHE6aauWp7cx9rweNmTLRbot-XygMBoazX67gDTLK2dX9llZXzF8WtwwWKJdbVE1InZ5hriQ4TQiJ0S6wQUZ1vuxdoEwU7dh6SOsrsZCUtEyFKpvaH0UFS" alt="" /></figure>



<p><em>Final confirmation to delete account</em><br></p>



<p>The code snippet which triggers the action to open the modal <em>confirmDeleteUserModal </em>is given below:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;<strong>button</strong> {{action openConfirmDeleteUserModal}} class="ui red button {{if isEmailDifferent 'disabled'}}"&gt;
   {{t 'Proceed'}}
&lt;/<strong>button</strong>&gt;</pre>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">   openConfirmDeleteUserModal() {
     <strong>this</strong>.setProperties({
       'isUserDeleteModalOpen'        : <strong>false</strong>,
       'confirmEmail'                 : '',
       'isConfirmUserDeleteModalOpen' : <strong>true</strong>,
       'checked'                      : <strong>false</strong>
     });
   }</pre>



<p>When user clicks the Delete<strong> </strong>button, it triggers <em>deleteUser </em>function, which finally deletes the user’s account and redirect him/her to index page.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The code snippet for <em>deleteUser</em> function:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">  deleteUser(user) {
     <strong>this</strong>.set('isLoading', <strong>true</strong>);
     user.destroyRecord()
       .<strong>then</strong>(() =&gt; {
         <strong>this</strong>.authManager.logout();
         <strong>this</strong>.routing.transitionTo('index');
         <strong>this</strong>.notify.success(<strong>this</strong>.l10n.t('Your account has been deleted successfully.'));
       })
       .<strong>catch</strong>(() =&gt; {
         <strong>this</strong>.notify.error(<strong>this</strong>.l10n.t('An unexpected error has occurred.'));
       })
       .<strong>finally</strong>(() =&gt; {
         <strong>this</strong>.setProperties({
           'isLoading'                    : <strong>false</strong>,
           'isConfirmUserDeleteModalOpen' : <strong>false</strong>,
           'checked'                      : <strong>false</strong>
         });
       });
   }</pre>



<p>To ensure that a user cannot delete his/her account via API call, if he/she is associated with event and/or orders, there is a check on server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The code snippet for this check:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>if</strong> data.get('deleted_at') != user.deleted_at:
    <strong>if</strong> has_access('is_user_itself', user_id=user.id) <strong>or</strong>  has_access('is_admin'):
        <strong>if</strong> data.get('deleted_at'):
             <strong>if</strong> len(user.events) != 0:
                 <strong>raise</strong> ForbiddenException({'source': ''},  "Users associated with events cannot  be deleted")
             <strong>elif</strong> len(user.orders) != 0:
                 <strong>raise</strong> ForbiddenException({'source': ''}, "Users associated with orders cannot be deleted")
             <strong>else</strong>:
                 modify_email_for_user_to_be_deleted(user)
        <strong>else</strong>:
             modify_email_for_user_to_be_restored(user)
             data['email'] = user.email
        user.deleted_at = data.get('deleted_at')
<strong>else</strong>:
     <strong>raise</strong> ForbiddenException({'source': ''}, "You are not authorized to update this information.")</pre>



<p>The helpers <em>modify_email_for_user_to_be_deleted</em> and <em>modify_email_for_user_to_be_restored</em> used in the above code snippet are responsible to update the email of user before deleting him/her or before restoring him/her respectively.<br></p>



<p>The helper <em>modify_email_for_user_to_be_deleted</em> updates the email ID of user which is to be deleted. It adds &#8216;.deleted&#8217; substring to email of a user to be deleted.</p>



<p>The helper <em>modify_email_for_user_to_be_restored </em>updates the email ID of user to be restored. It removes &#8216;.deleted&#8217; substring from a user to be restored. If the email ID obtained after removing ‘.deleted’ from the email ID, we get an email ID which already exists in the system then an error is raised &#8211; <em>This email is already registered! Manually edit and then try restoring</em></p>



<p>We understand that in today’s era, everyone is a bit sceptical about their data and so we now provide freedom to our user to delete their account whenever they want.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several modules of <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend">Open Event Frontend</a> involve the use of custom forms, which currently are not truly custom in the sense that they are really restricted, and rigid. Only text fields are available, along with hardcoded dropdowns. Further, the user is only able to select from among the hardcoded fields and toggle them on/off for his/her event.<br></p>



<p>Any component which extends the form mixin can make specify the validations required using the <em>getValidationRules</em> hook.<br></p>



<p>Current custom forms are really restricted, and rigid. Only text fields are available, along with hardcoded dropdowns. Further, the user is only able to select from among the hardcoded fields and toggle them on/off for his/her event.<br></p>



<p>We already have the framework to associate simple custom fields with individual events or orders, and an API to create them. The custom forms schema needs to be now expanded to allow more complex fields. Taking Google forms and our use case as an inspiration, the user should be able to create the following fields:<br></p>



<ul><li>Simple text *</li><li>Paragraph *</li><li>Radio Buttons (single choice)</li><li>Checkboxes</li><li>Dropdown</li><li>File upload *</li><li>Time</li><li>Date</li><li>Date &amp; Time</li></ul>



<p>* Already implemented<br></p>



<p>The schema needs expansion to accommodate options for fields like dropdowns, checkboxes and radio buttons. Also, to store custom labels to the fields, which the user assigns. Currently, they are hardcoded by comparing the name of the field with if-else.</p>



<p><br>Thus we propose the following schema related changes to accomodate the complex custom forms.</p>



<p>Add a separate model called <em>customFormOptions</em> to store various options of radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns.<br></p>



<p>They will have the following fields:<br></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Column</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>ID</td><td>default unique ID</td></tr><tr><td>value</td><td>value of the custom form field options like &#8216;XS, XL&#8217;</td></tr><tr><td>custom_form_id</td><td>foreign key &#8211; the id of the custom form field this option belongs to</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p></p>



<p>CustomForm model will have a <em>hasMany</em> relationship with <em>customFormOptions</em>.<br></p>



<p>For text fields, and other fields which don’t require options within them can have the relationship as null.<br></p>



<p>The changes to <em>customForm</em> Model itself:</p>



<p></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Column</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>description</td><td>An optional simple string column to store the custom messages/info the user may give to the custom form field like T-shirt Size Chart link etc.</td></tr><tr><td>isComplex</td><td>Boolean field to indicate if a particular field is complex</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>The changes to<em> event, speaker, session </em>Models:<br></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Column</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>customFormValues</td><td>A <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/datatypejson.html">JSON type column</a> which stores all the complex custom form values(currently all the fields offered are hardcoded in the schema)</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>This expansion of schemas will allow the clients to create new, custom fields as per the requirement of the system. Future work may involve creating an API for validations of these fields.</p>

<p>Several modules of <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend">Open Event Frontend</a> involve start and end date-times. While for simple type fields like text, dropdowns or radio buttons, default semantic UI validations are available, which are used inside the app via the form mixin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any component which extends the form mixin can make specify the validations required using the <em>getValidationRules</em> hook.</p>



<p>For instance, this set of rules will enforce validations on the field called <em>ticket_price </em>which will prohibit it from being left empty, or something other than a real number.</p>

<p>The validations provided by semantic UI only extend to single fields, and are independent of each other. However, in our use case we have four fields:</p>



<ol><li>Start date</li><li>Start time</li><li>End date</li><li>End time</li></ol>



<p>The general requirement is that the DateTime object formed by joining the start date and the start time should be before the DateTime object obtained by joining the end date and time. Also, these four distributed fields exist only on the frontend, on the server they are actually just two fields startsAt and endsAt each carrying UTC time values of DateTime objects. To split them into date and time a new computed function is created which is invoked in the model definitions of various resources. Consider the two following complex fields defined in the model according to the schema on the server.</p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000"> startsAt               <span style="color:#b060b0">:</span> attr<span style="color:#d2cd86">(</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">moment</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">)</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">,</span>
 endsAt                 <span style="color:#b060b0">:</span> attr<span style="color:#d2cd86">(</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">moment</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">)</span>
</pre>




<p>In order to split them into two that helper is used as follows:</p>



<p></p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">startsAtDate <span style="color:#b060b0">:</span> computedDateTimeSplit<span style="color:#d2cd86">.</span><span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">bind</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">(</span><span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">this</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">)</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">(</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">startsAt</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">,</span> <span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">date</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">,</span> <span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">endsAt</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">)</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">,</span>

<p>These values can then be used inside individual fields. To enhance the user experience <em>jquery Calendar </em>module is used to allow the user to enter the date and time values using a calendar and time picker as shown below.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/oA09IeMSkzVDNyjcDtjiqzpz5LOAloiA21FU7_NjNeISrE1dzVu9tzEy9_xx1UX-aYD_TLkRekitYgc0suBhVY3K4UZRvMqINwLYzEkj0NOrphJWCewUv653sJ1lIwFG0AQ-j0eu" alt="" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>The <em>computedDateTimeSplit </em>helper, takes in the property whose part it is splitting, along with the specification of the part it will split. It also takes an optional endProperty argument, which is passed if it is being called for a start property. This function returns a pair of getters and setters,the get function returns the part of datetime object requested like, date or time where as the setter sets these values each time this function is called.</p>

<p>With this complex set up it is not possible to use semantic UI validations, hence we extend the default semantic UI validations, by introducing&nbsp; custom rules for the form.</p>



<p>A rule called <em>checkDates </em>is introduced inside the <em>getValidationRules </em>hook.<br></p>

<p>This hook manually compares the end and start datetime objects, and if they are in violation, it returns false, which triggers a semantic UI styled validation.</p>



<p>To enforce the validation, the start and end datetime fields are embedded with&nbsp;</p>

<p>However one big problem with this approach is the clearing of validation messages, when one field is in violation, technically all four are in violation as you can either adjust the start time or end time to make the datetimes valid. However, semantic UI validations which operate upon the <em>blur</em> listening property operate with respect to a single field at a time, and any changes to a particular field does not retrigger validations on others. So, for instance an end date was added which was occurring on the same date as a start date, and times are the same too, the form will throw validation on all four fields. However, if we just change the time of one of the dates, the dates will be valid again, but the validation error dialogs of only that field will disappear which was actually modified. This default behavior of semantic UI problematic for us.&nbsp;<br></p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">onChange<span style="color:#d2cd86">(</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">)</span> <span style="color:#b060b0">{</span>
      <span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">this</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">.</span>onValid<span style="color:#d2cd86">(</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">(</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">)</span> <span style="color:#d2cd86">=</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#b060b0">{</span><span style="color:#b060b0">}</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">)</span><span style="color:#b060b0">;</span>
    <span style="color:#b060b0">}</span>
</pre>




<p></p>



<p>Thus an <em>onChange </em>action is attached with the <em>focus-out</em> event of the date and time inputs</p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000"><span style="color:#b060b0">{</span><span style="color:#b060b0">{</span>input type<span style="color:#d2cd86">=</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">text</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span> value<span style="color:#d2cd86">=</span>value placeholder<span style="color:#d2cd86">=</span>placeholder name<span style="color:#d2cd86">=</span>name focus<span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span>out<span style="color:#d2cd86">=</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">(</span>action <span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">onChange</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">)</span><span style="color:#b060b0">}</span><span style="color:#b060b0">}</span>
</pre>




<p>This action triggers the validations on the entire form, which will clear at any redundant validation error prompts still remaining in the form. As a future improvement, instead of <em>onChange</em> triggering validations on the entire form, only the datetimes can be revalidated, though this will require extension of the form mixin to support more flexible methods to validate forms using latest semantic UI APIs.<br></p>

<p>This blog article will continue the discussions about setting up ember tables on open event frontend. The implementation and design of the search module of the ember tables will be discussed.<br></p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server">Open event server</a> supports searching, using filter queries offered by <a href="https://flask-rest-jsonapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">flask-rest-json-api&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Leveraging the <em>refreshModel</em> property of the <em>queryParams</em>, we can bind the value of a potential search query of a user to a <em>queryParam</em>. As the user types the query, the <em>queryParam</em> will change, which in turn will refresh the model, and send a new request to the server, giving the impression of a basic search.</p>



<p>An icon input field with a search icon is placed on the top right corner of the table wrapped in its own separate component, <em>search-box. </em>The component is rendered within the <em>default</em> table component, which acts as a base for all other tables in the app.</p>



<p>Here, <em>searchQuery</em> is binded to the param <em>search</em> defined in the controller mixin for ember tables.<br></p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000"><span style="color:#d2cd86">&lt;</span>div <span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">class</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">=</span><span style="color:#02d045">"</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">ui small icon input</span><span style="color:#02d045">"</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">&gt;</span>

</pre>




<p></p>



<p>Now in order to generate the query string which will result in a search involves complex array filter manipulations, hence the logic was abstracted into the route mixin to avoid it’s repetition across various routes.</p>



<p>Flast-rest-json api’s filters follow the following format for a&nbsp; basic like styled sql filter:</p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">GET <span style="color:#d2cd86">/</span>events<span style="color:#b060b0">?</span><span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">filter</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">=</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">[</span>

</pre>




<p></p>



<p>There are several other query combinations available for comparison, dates and other data-types or for relationships themselves. They needed to be appended to the filter portion of a query and then removed.</p>



<p>When the search param is null, the query string has the following form:</p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000"><span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">let</span> queryString <span style="color:#d2cd86">=</span> <span style="color:#b060b0">{</span>
      include        <span style="color:#b060b0">:</span> <span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">tickets,user</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">,</span>
      <span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">filter</span>         <span style="color:#b060b0">:</span> filterOptions<span style="color:#d2cd86">,</span>
      <span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">page[size]</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span>   <span style="color:#b060b0">:</span> params<span style="color:#d2cd86">.</span>per_page <span style="color:#d2cd86">||</span> <span style="color:#008c00">10</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">,</span>
      <span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">page[number]</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span> <span style="color:#b060b0">:</span> params<span style="color:#d2cd86">.</span>page <span style="color:#d2cd86">||</span> <span style="color:#008c00">1</span>
    <span style="color:#b060b0">}</span><span style="color:#b060b0">;</span>
</pre>




<p><em>filterOptions</em> are other filters already present, for instance for listing orders on the basis of a dynamic status parameter,&nbsp; <em>filterOptions</em> can be defined as follows.</p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000"> filterOptions <span style="color:#d2cd86">=</span> <span style="color:#d2cd86">[</span>
        <span style="color:#b060b0">{</span>
          name <span style="color:#b060b0">:</span> <span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">status</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">,</span>
          op   <span style="color:#b060b0">:</span> <span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">eq</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">,</span>
          val  <span style="color:#b060b0">:</span> params<span style="color:#d2cd86">.</span>orders_status
        <span style="color:#b060b0">}</span>
      <span style="color:#d2cd86">]</span><span style="color:#b060b0">;</span>
</pre>




<p>Since <em>filterOptions</em> are an array, new filters are either added or appended to the array.<br></p>

<p>Thus a method called <em>applySearchFilters</em> is defined in the<em> ember-table-router</em> mixin.</p>



<p>It takes three arguments:</p>



<ul><li><em>options</em></li><li><em>params</em></li><li><em>searchField</em></li></ul>



<p><em>Options </em>is the filter array, discussed above, params contains the value of the current search param, and the <em>searchField</em> is the target of the search which is defined in the route’s model hook itself. The open-event-api server, expects the name of fields in kebab case, where as the front-end uses camelCase, hence the <em>searchField</em> is explicitly converted into a <em>kebab-case</em> string before manipulating the filter array. If params are present, it appends the filter object to the queryString, else this function will remove the very filter it added to the query string.</p>



<p>Finally in the route’s model hook itself, queryString is passed to this function, and the filters get applied to it.</p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">    queryString <span style="color:#d2cd86">=</span> <span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">this</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">.</span>applySortFilters<span style="color:#d2cd86">(</span>queryString<span style="color:#d2cd86">,</span> params<span style="color:#d2cd86">)</span><span style="color:#b060b0">;</span>
</pre>




<p></p>



<p>Semantic UI has a dedicated class for search input fields, which has been used in the template. As a future goal, a slight delay can be introduced in the update cycle of the <em>search</em> queryParam, currently a network request is sent on each keystroke of the user’s input which can be taxing for the server. Introducing a slight delay or alternatively cancelling a request no longer needed will improve latency and response time of the API server, until elastic search is introduced.<br></p>

<p>This blog article will continue the discussions about setting up ember tables on <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend">open event frontend</a>. The implementation and design of the pagination module of the ember tables will be discussed.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server">Open event server</a> uses JSON:API spec. Whenever the server returns a query, the JSON contains a meta field, that field contains the total number of records on the API server, which satisfy the query. This number, of course is different from the actual number of records returned which depend on the page size, and page number. But this serves as a good starting point for implementing the pagination module. For the open event server, the property inside the meta tag which contains the total count is called <em>count</em>. Using this property we define a computed property called <em>totalContentLength</em>.<br></p>

<p>Ember has great support for queryParams, and if in their declaration inside the route, the property <em>refreshModel </em>is set to true, then the model refreshes and reloads the data whenever the query params update. Thus, the current page and page size are maintained in the form of query params. </p>



<p>For computing the total number of pages (<em>pageCount</em>),&nbsp; that the content will be split in, we have all three required variables, <em>totalContentLength </em>(computed above), currentPage and pageSize (both available as queryParams).<br></p>



<p>Once we have pagesCount, it is easy to decide if moving forward or backwards is possible and can themselves be stored as computed properties. Similarly, in order to move forwards or backwards by a page, or to last or first pages, the queryParam for currentPage can be altered.</p>

<p>We also need to display, what is the current range of entries being shown. For eg, <em>Showing 20-30 of 100 </em>entries. This can again be computed by using current page, page size and&nbsp; total number of entries.<br></p>



<p>Using all of these computed properties, we can render the template for a pagination menu, which the user can use in order to navigate through the data.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Semantic UI has a dedicated class for pagination menu, which has been used in this template. The buttons are disabled as per the computed properties to enhance the user experience.</p>

<p></p>



<p>This blog article will illustrate how ember tables were set up, reopened as a component, for customization and how the pagination module was implemented.<br></p>



<p>Ember source 3.11 which <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server/pull/6331/files">Open event frontend</a> uses is not compatible with the last release of ember tables, hence the master branch of ember tables which does support the latest ember source was chosen.&nbsp; To install a dependency from a Github repository link instead of a yarn package, we can use<br></p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">yarn add addepar<span style="color:#d2cd86">/</span>ember<span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span>table#0aa5637
</pre>




<p>Ember tables offer no inbuilt theme, and use the default HTML styles. They do have support for styling, but only via CSS selectors in CSS files. In our use case, we needed the styling to be those of semantic UI tables. However, for that the classes had to be added inside the table element, and ember tables by default, don’t allow addition of classes, as the table was under other layers. Even if the classNames property of component had&nbsp; been specified, it would just append the specified class names to the wrapper of the table element, not the actual table itself. Ember’s reopen feature was used to solve this problem. The reopen method allows ‘reopening’ of the component in the sense that it’s existing properties can be overwritten, or new properties can be added.<br></p>



<p>It is a convention to store the reopened component files in a folder separate from external folder.</p>



<p>The definition of the table was inside a component.js file inside the source of ember tables. Hence a new file located at <em>app/extensions/ember-table/component.js </em>was created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then the component.js was reopened to change the source of the template file which is used for ember tables.<br></p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000"><span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">import</span> component from <span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">ember-table/components/ember-table/component</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#b060b0">;</span>
<span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">import</span> layout from <span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">./template</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#b060b0">;</span>

component<span style="color:#d2cd86">.</span>reopen<span style="color:#d2cd86">(</span><span style="color:#b060b0">{</span>
  layout
<span style="color:#b060b0">}</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">)</span><span style="color:#b060b0">;</span>
</pre>




<p>This reopening modifies the ember table component, such that it now searches for the layout file in the new directory at <em>ember-table/components/ember-table/layout.hbs</em><br></p>



<p>The file <em>layout.hbs </em>now contains&nbsp;</p>

</pre>




<p>It is the exact same file which was present in the source of ember tables, with the only modification being the addition of class <em>ui unstackable table</em> to the table element. This class makes the table support semantic UI styling.<br></p>



<p>Ember tables follow a structure similar to ember model tables, wherein the columns are defined inside the controller of the route which will render the table. However, it is not possible to pass the actions defined in the controller to the final cell components for columns without passing them throughout until the very last layer. I.e. actions of controller are not passed to the custom cell components, automatically. Specifying them explicitly results in loss of generalisation, and a significant portion of code will be repeated.&nbsp; Also, sometimes, we might need to pass more than one <em>valuePaths </em>if we don’t need to pass the entire entity, if a column cell needs only some of the properties. Custom options were a requirement as well. Hence, to generalise these properties, the expanded form of&nbsp; ember table from ember table docs was slightly modified to :</p>

<p>Two additions were made in terms of properties passed to a cell in the table.</p>



<p>A <em>props</em> object, which is a hash of the <em>options</em> and <em>actions </em>properties which will be defined inside the columns definition as column properties.<br></p>



<p>Also the <em>extraValuePaths</em> are passed as <em>extraRecords</em> using <em>getProperties</em>&nbsp; helper.</p>



<p>The <em>getProperties</em> helper takes in an object and a list of properties, it then returns those properties of an object, as&nbsp; hash.<br></p>

<p></p>



<p>An important thing to note is that even though the actions defined in the controller can be passed in the <em>actions</em> property, they still require a correct context of this. That is achieved using binding the current context of this to them before passing.<br></p>

<p>The example above shows how the correct context of this is binded with actions.<br></p>



<p>The next blog will cover more details about the implementation ember tables, and focus on various utilities present inside tables like pagination, searching and sorting.</p>

<p>This blog will showcase how test email module was developed for open event.&nbsp; This required implementing a new API endpoint on the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server">Open event server</a>, and it’s subsequent integration on the front-end. The test email functionality essentially tests if a given mail configuration is successfully able to deliver mail. The user gets an option to enter any email, and then trigger a test mail to that address. The tester may manually verify then if an email has been received.<br></p>



<p>In&nbsp; <em>app/api/helpers/system_mails.py a</em> field for the test email is added.</p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">TEST_MAIL<span style="color:#b060b0">:</span> <span style="color:#b060b0">{</span>
        <span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">recipient</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#b060b0">:</span> <span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">User</span><span style="color:#02d045">'</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">,</span>

        <span style="color:#d2cd86">)</span>
    <span style="color:#b060b0">}</span>
</pre>




<p>And in the helper file at <em>app/api/helpers/mail.py,</em> a function for sending a test mail is added.</p>

<p>Since this is a trivial route, with no data exchange, we will implement this as a miscellaneous route under the <em>settings</em> API. Also, it is important that the route is restricted for use only by an admin.</p>



<p><em>Decorators</em> are used to ensure that.</p>

<p>The endpoint&nbsp;only accepts POST requests, whose body should contain a field called <em>recipient </em>which contains the email address to which the test mail should be sent.</p>



<p>With the API endpoint for test emails ready, a small form needs to be added on the front-end in the admin area.</p>



<p>A new form for this field was added within the form of general system settings.<br></p>

<p>Additionally, email validations are added to the field which accepts the email input. This module after it’s implementation is able to handle both cases, if the mail endpoint returns an error status code, this means mail send function on the server is broken, or the configuration is misconfigured in an unexpected manner. If it returns a successful status, and yet mail has not been received on the desired email address, this might point to a deeper problem regarding, the sending mail getting blacklisted or otherwise.</p>

<p>This summer, <a href="https://eventyay.com/">Open Event</a> project has 3 different payment gateways integrated in its system enabling the user base a wider base of options to buy their tickets and pay the organizers and hence making the platform more user friendly. In the initial period <a href="https://omise.co/">Omise gateway</a> was implemented and properly documented in the first phase while <a href="https://intl.alipay.com/">Alipay</a> was subsequently implemented in the middle of the coding period. In the late phase, the focus has been shifted to Indian payment gateways and <a href="https://developer.paytm.com/docs/">PayTM</a> came out as prime choice considering it’s popularity and ease of integration with the existing technology stack.</p>



<p>This requires two different modals to be added to <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend">frontend</a> project to felicitate the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server">open-event-server</a> hits being made on PayTM’s API services.</p>



<p>The first modal’s skeleton design is to check paytm wallets as the payment option and acquire the mobile number to be used.</p>



<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><code>// app/templates/components/modals/paytm-payment-options.hbs<br><br>&lt;</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code> class="header"&gt;<br> {{t 'Amount to be paid:'}} {{currency-symbol currency}} {{amount}}<br>&lt;/</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code>&gt;<br><br>&lt;</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code> class="content"&gt;<br> &lt;</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code> class="muted small text"&gt;<br>   {{t 'Select an option to pay'}}<br> &lt;/</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code>&gt;<br> &lt;</code><strong><code>form</code></strong><code> class="ui form" autocomplete="off" {{action 'openOTPController' on='submit' preventDefault=true}}&gt;<br>   &lt;</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code> class="field"&gt;<br>     {{ui-radio name='payment_mode' value='paytm' onChange=(action (mut isWalletSelected))}}<br>     {{t 'Paytm Wallet'}}&lt;</code><strong><code>img</code></strong><code> src="/images/payment-logos/paytm.png" alt="paytm"&gt;<br>   &lt;/</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code>&gt;<br>   {{#</code><strong><code>if</code></strong><code> isWalletSelected}}<br>     &lt;</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code> class="field"&gt;<br>       &lt;</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code> class="label"&gt;<br>         {{t 'Please enter your Paytm registered Mobile Number to continue'}}<br>       &lt;/</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code>&gt;<br>       {{input type='number' id='mobile_number' value=mobileNumber required=true}}<br>     &lt;/</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code>&gt;<br>   {{/</code><strong><code>if</code></strong><code>}}<br> &lt;/</code><strong><code>form</code></strong><code>&gt;<br>&lt;/</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code>&gt;<br><br>&lt;</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code> class="actions"&gt;<br> &lt;</code><strong><code>button</code></strong><code> type="button" class="ui black button" {{action 'close'}}&gt;<br>   {{t 'Cancel'}}<br> &lt;/</code><strong><code>button</code></strong><code>&gt;<br> &lt;</code><strong><code>button</code></strong><code> {{action openOTPController}} class="ui green button" disabled={{not isWalletSelected}}&gt;<br>   {{t 'Proceed'}}<br> &lt;/</code><strong><code>button</code></strong><code>&gt;<br>&lt;/</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code>&gt;</code></td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>This simple modal design implementation resulted in the skeleton design of the first modal which can be seen as following:<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nCN0Wr9g2dS8Yuhgaa3H6jMgxx_aaik507SUusbkf1dq3zflqzgDB73q_1Qiyqkhv7CCIzv-qPvvDGi4VQGvREtODk5RPIBVQx5TGutkAuCWzL2KHl2Ah7iIRQLBPaftsVLctVtA" alt="" /><figcaption>OTP sending modal</figcaption></figure>



<p>The second modal required a simple API hit integration which will be validating the acquired OTP. This was designed rather simply with the following snippet:<br></p>



<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><code>// app/templates/components/modals/paytm-otp.hbs<br>&lt;</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code> class="header"&gt;<br> {{t 'Amount to be paid:'}} {{currency-symbol currency}} {{amount}}<br>&lt;/</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code>&gt;<br><br>&lt;</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code> class="content"&gt;<br> {{t 'Enter OTP sent to mobile number'}}<br> &lt;</code><strong><code>form</code></strong><code> class="ui form" autocomplete="off"&gt;<br>   &lt;</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code> class="field"&gt;<br>     {{input type='number' id='otp' value=otp required=true}}<br>   &lt;/</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code>&gt;<br> &lt;/</code><strong><code>form</code></strong><code>&gt;<br>&lt;/</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code>&gt;<br>&lt;</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code> class="actions"&gt;<br> &lt;</code><strong><code>button</code></strong><code> type="button" class="ui black button" {{action 'close'}}&gt;<br>   {{t 'Cancel'}}<br> &lt;/</code><strong><code>button</code></strong><code>&gt;<br> &lt;</code><strong><code>button</code></strong><code> class="ui green button"&gt;<br>   {{t 'Verify'}}<br> &lt;/</code><strong><code>button</code></strong><code>&gt;<br>&lt;/</code><strong><code>div</code></strong><code>&gt;</code></td></tr></tbody></table>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bWN3RCkylsPf9J96cI40qcvRewcdhfrk0oU-3GG8KUt7hHdh4MEdNXdt6Ty3IQnFqMKDIWFzNTDXPk5Sxy0EgIfDNUFTUVAkzVgpNHQAwt2TOJJwCvEuPA988dG4vb5c0s3rO7cK" alt="" /><figcaption>OTP confirmation modal</figcaption></figure>



<p>These modals were controlled by adding corresponding pop-up logic in the <strong>pending.js</strong> controller focusing on the clicks on Proceed and verify buttons respectively.</p>



<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><code>// app/controllers/orders/pending.js<br>   openPaytmModal() {<br>     // Model controller for PaytmModal<br>     this.setProperties({<br>       'isPaytmModalOpen': true<br>     });<br>   },<br><br>   openOTPController() {<br>     // Modal controller for OTP step<br>     this.setProperties({<br>       'isPaytmModalOpen' : false,<br>       'isOTPModalOpen'   : true<br>     });<br>   }</code></td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>This concludes the design walk through of custom PayTM checkout modals. These will be integrated with the APIs to complete the backend workflow and hence adding PayTM as another payment option!</p>

<p>This blog article will illustrate how, after significant refactors, eventyay.com was switched from <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-legacy">open-event-legacy </a>to the new version of open-event which has a decoupled open-event-API-server and frontend. We will discuss this switch from two aspects &#8211; the database migration and the DevOps logistic, as we moved from google cloud to a&nbsp; more economically feasible platform &#8211; hetzner cloud.<br></p>



<p><strong>Downloading a copy of the </strong>legacy database from Kubernetes pod on the <strong>google cloud platform</strong></p>



<p>The first step, was to obtain a copy of the database being used in production. The database was stored inside a pod named Postgres of the Kubernetes cluster.<br></p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">gcloud login
gcloud container clusters get<span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span>credentials vintage<span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span>cluster <span style="color:#d2cd86">--</span>zone us<span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span>west1<span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span>a <span style="color:#d2cd86">--</span>project eventyay
</pre>




<p>These commands initialized and authenticated the gcloud sdk with the project eventyay.</p>



<p>Next, to gain bash access to the postgres pod, <em>exec</em> of kubectl CLI was used.</p>



kubectl exec -it postgres &#8212; /bin/bash



<p>The database in both the new and legacy versions was postgresSql. Using the pg_dump functionality, a database can be dumped into a transferable file</p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">kubectl <span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">exec</span> <span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span>it postgres <span style="color:#d2cd86">--</span> <span style="color:#d2cd86">/</span>bin<span style="color:#d2cd86">/</span>bash
</pre>




<p>However this file still resides on the kubernetes pod’s local storage&nbsp; itself. The <em>cp</em> utility of kubectl CLI comes in handy to copy that file from pod to local storage.&nbsp;</p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">kubectl cp <span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">default</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">/</span>postgres<span style="color:#b060b0">:</span>legacy<span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span><span style="color:#008c00">24</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span><span style="color:#008c00">03</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span><span style="color:#009f00">2019.</span>pgsql <span style="color:#d2cd86">~</span><span style="color:#02d045">/</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">Downloads</span><span style="color:#02d045">/</span>
</pre>




<p>This command transfers the file to local storage. Now we have a database we can begin to refactor, for this we first need to import it into the postgres instance on the local machine, to take a peek inside the schema.</p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">Psql <span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span>U postgres
Create database legacy_24_03_2019
Create database legacy_24_03_2019_reference
postgres legacy_24_03_2019 <span style="color:#d2cd86">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#d2cd86">~</span><span style="color:#02d045">/</span><span style="color:#00c4c4">Downloads</span><span style="color:#02d045">/</span>legacy<span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span><span style="color:#008c00">24</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span><span style="color:#008c00">03</span><span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span><span style="color:#009f00">2019.</span>pgsql 
</pre>




<p>These commands dump the data inside the&nbsp; legacy database into the newly created database inside the Postgres instance. The schema and architecture of the new version of server is different from the legacy database, hence DB has to go through migrations.</p>



<p>The last migration file shared by legacy and the next gen of server is corresponding to the migration <strong>ddaa6df27340</strong>.</p>



<p>However, it is important to note that the migrations branched from here onwards. Hence to downgrade the databse to the last legacy migration, we need to use the migrations folder of the legacy version of eventyay and not the original migrations directory<br></p>



<p>Assuming that the migrations from the legacy server stiored in a folder called migrations-legacy<br></p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">mv migrations migrations<span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span><span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">new</span>
mv migrations<span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span>legacy migrations
Change the config <span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">in</span> the local <span style="color:#d2cd86">.</span>env inside open<span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span>event<span style="color:#d2cd86">-</span>server to <span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">switch</span> to <span style="color:#e66170;font-weight:bold">this</span> newly created database<span style="color:#d2cd86">.</span>
9d21de792967
Ticket holder thing
python manage<span style="color:#d2cd86">.</span>py db downgrade ddaa6df27340
</pre>




<p>Then we upgrade to the latest instance of the db<br></p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">Switch back the directories

</pre>




<p></p>



<p>Then we upgrade the database&nbsp;</p>




<pre style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000">Python manage<span style="color:#d2cd86">.</span>py db upgrade
</pre>




<p></p>



<p>These commands migrate the database in principal, and we have a basic system with core functionality using legacy data but the database is not at all ready to be used in production yet. It is rife with bugs. The migrations file don’t cover each change, and some are outright breaking. Some have problems like comma separated values being converted into their own schemas&nbsp; without any migration written for them. These issues were tackled separately.</p>



<p>Most significant of these was the scripts written to convert legacy comma separated data format of custom forms&nbsp; into a separate schema.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android">open event attendee</a> is an android app which allows users to discover events happening around the world using the Open Event Platform. It consumes the APIs of the open event server to get a list of available events and can get detailed information about them.<br></p>



<p>We are using default API for <a href="https://api.eventyay.com/">eventyay</a> app. Server configuration is something when we replace backend API with a new one and perform the same applications with the different server. As it is a fully open-source project on F-droid, so we have enabled the server configuration field for the F-droid build variant.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Let’s analyze every step in detail.<br></p>



<h2>Retrofit and Okhttp for Network Call</h2>



<p>Using Retrofit for your Android app&#8217;s networking can make your life so much easier. However, Retrofit&#8217;s design requires a single Retrofit instance for each API with a different base URL. Consequently, if your app is talking to two or more APIs (under different URLs), you&#8217;ll need to deal with at least two Retrofit instances.<br></p>



<p>Retrofit is a type-safe REST client for Android, Java, and Kotlin developed by Square. The library provides a powerful framework for authenticating and interacting with APIs and sending network requests with OkHttp.<br></p>

        }</pre>



<p>Set URL to preferences in the view model and end current session:</p>



<pre class="hljs" style="padding: 0.5em"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">fun</span> <span class="hljs-title" style="font-weight: 700">changeApiUrl</span><span class="hljs-params">(url: <span class="hljs-type">String</span>)</span></span> {
        preference.putString(API_URL, url)
        logout()
    }</pre>



<h2>Create Interceptor to Handle New API URL</h2>



<p>Here default API URL is set to the retrofit already:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="hljs" style="padding: 0.5em"><span class="hljs-selector-tag" style="font-weight: 700">Retrofit</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.Builder</span>()
            <span class="hljs-selector-class">.client</span>(<span class="hljs-selector-tag" style="font-weight: 700">get</span>())
            <span class="hljs-selector-class">.baseUrl</span>(<span class="hljs-selector-tag" style="font-weight: 700">baseUrl</span>)
            <span class="hljs-selector-class">.build</span>()</pre>



<p>As we discussed earlier OkHttp handles every network call for the application. So here we track the URL host from the okhttp interceptor. If the URL host is equaled to the default API URL host, then we can say that it is an API call and then we can replace same with the host getting from preferences if it is not null and set the interceptor to okhttp client builder.<br></p>



<p>Create host selection interceptor class to return interceptor with the API URL:</p>



<pre class="hljs" style="padding: 0.5em">class HostSelectionInterceptor(private val preference: Preference) : Interceptor {

    <span class="hljs-attribute" style="font-weight: 700">override fun intercept(chain</span>: Interceptor<span class="hljs-variable">.Chain</span>): Response {
        var original = chain<span class="hljs-variable">.request</span>()
        val httpUrl = preference<span class="hljs-variable">.getString</span>(API_URL)?<span class="hljs-variable">.toHttpUrlOrNull</span>()
        if (original<span class="hljs-variable">.url</span><span class="hljs-variable">.host</span> == BuildConfig<span class="hljs-variable">.DEFAULT_BASE_URL</span><span class="hljs-variable">.toHttpUrlOrNull</span>()?<span class="hljs-variable">.host</span> &amp;&amp; httpUrl != null) {
            val newUrl =
                original<span class="hljs-variable">.url</span><span class="hljs-variable">.newBuilder</span>()
                    <span class="hljs-variable">.scheme</span>(httpUrl<span class="hljs-variable">.scheme</span>)
                    <span class="hljs-variable">.host</span>(httpUrl<span class="hljs-variable">.host</span>)
                    <span class="hljs-variable">.port</span>(httpUrl<span class="hljs-variable">.port</span>)
                    <span class="hljs-variable">.build</span>()
            original = original<span class="hljs-variable">.newBuilder</span>()
                <span class="hljs-variable">.url</span>(newUrl)
                <span class="hljs-variable">.build</span>()
        }
        return chain<span class="hljs-variable">.proceed</span>(original)
    }
}</pre>



<p>Set the interceptor to okhttp client builder:</p>



<pre class="hljs" style="padding: 0.5em"><span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">val</span> builder = OkHttpClient().newBuilder()
            .addInterceptor(HostSelectionInterceptor(<span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">get</span>()))</pre>

<p><a href="https://susi.ai/admin">SUSI.AI Admin Panel</a> now allows the Admin to create, read, update and delete config keys present in system settings. Config keys are API keys which are used to link the application to third party services like Google Maps, Google ReCaptcha, Google Analytics, Matomo, etc. The API key is a unique identifier that is used to authenticate requests associated with the project for usage and billing purposes.</p>



<h2>CRUD Operations</h2>



<h3>Create Config Key</h3>



<p>To create a config key click on “Add Config Key” Button, a dialog opens up which has two field Key Name and Key Value. <strong>this.props.actions.openModal</strong> opens up the shared Dialog Modal. On clicking on “Create”, the <strong>createApiKey</strong> is called which takes in the two parameters.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">handleCreate = () =&gt; {
   this.props.actions.openModal({
     modalType: 'createSystemSettings',
     type: 'Create',
     handleConfirm: this.confirmUpdate,
     keyName: this.state.keyName,
     keyValue: this.state.keyValue,
     handleClose: this.props.actions.closeModal,
   });
 };
 handleSave = () =&gt; {
   const { keyName, keyValue } = this.state;
   const { handleConfirm } = this.props;
   createApiKey({ keyName, keyValue })
     .then(() =&gt; handleConfirm())
     .catch(error =&gt; {
       console.log(error);
     });
 }; </pre>



<h3>Read Config Key</h3>



<p>API endpoint <strong>fetchApiKeys</strong> is called on componentDidMount and when Config Key is created, updated or deleted.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"> fetchApiKeys = () =&gt; {
   fetchApiKeys()
     .then(payload =&gt; {
       let apiKeys = [];
       let i = 1;
       let keys = Object.keys(payload.keys);
       keys.forEach(j =&gt; {
         const apiKey = {
           serialNum: i,
           keyName: j,
           value: payload.keys[j],
         };
         ++i;
         apiKeys.push(apiKey);
       });
       this.setState({
         apiKeys: apiKeys,
         loading: false,
       });
     })
     .catch(error =&gt; {
       console.log(error);
     });
 };</pre>



<h3>Update Config Key</h3>



<p>To Update a config key click on edit from the actions column, Update Config Key dialog opens up which allows you to edit the key value. On clicking on update, the <strong>createApiKey</strong> API is called.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"> handleUpdate = row =&gt; {
   this.props.actions.openModal({
     modalType: 'updateSystemSettings',
     type: 'Update',
     keyName: row.keyName,
     keyValue: row.value,
     handleConfirm: this.confirmUpdate,
     handleClose: this.props.actions.closeModal,
   });
 };</pre>



<h3>Delete Config Key</h3>



<p>To delete a config key click on delete from actions column, delete config key confirmation dialog opens up. On clicking on Delete, the <strong>deleteApiKey</strong> is called which takes in key name as parameter.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"> handleDelete = row =&gt; {
   this.setState({ keyName: row.keyName });
   this.props.actions.openModal({
     modalType: 'deleteSystemSettings',
     keyName: row.keyName,
     handleConfirm: this.confirmDelete,
     handleClose: this.props.actions.closeModal,
   });
 };
 confirmDelete = () =&gt; {
   const { keyName } = this.state;
   deleteApiKey({ keyName })
     .then(this.fetchApiKeys)
     .catch(error =&gt; {
       console.log(error);
     });
   this.props.actions.closeModal();
 };</pre>



<p>In conclusion, CRUD operations of Config Keys help admins to manage third party services. With these operations the admin can manage the API keys of various services without having to look for them in the backend.</p>

<p>In this blog, I will explain the feature to generate “Config File” in <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-android">PSLab Android Application</a> </p>



<h2><strong>What is a Config File?</strong></h2>



<p>The main aim of this feature is to make PSLab board a self data logger, which would read user-defined configs from a config file stored on SD card connected to PSLab board and based on instrument, parameters and time interval stored in config file PSLab board would automatically log those values. </p>



<p>Now as the first step of this feature, an option is added to PSLab Android application, where user can create a config file. User can select an instrument, parameters associated with that instrument and time interval. With this feature, user can easily generate a config file which can later be used by PSLab board for logging.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the screenshot above the user can select instruments for which the config file needs to be created from a drop-down menu. User can specify the time interval, for which the data should be logged by the PSLab board. Based on the instrument selected by the user corresponding parameters will be shown at the bottom. User can select whichever parameters are required and click on “CREATE CONFIG FILE” button and a config file will be saved on device local storage. </p>



<p>A config file for Oscilloscope with 25-sec interval and CH1, CH2 and CH3 parameters would look something like below,</p>

<h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>



<p>When a user clicks on Create Config File button, First we check whether the user has provided a time interval, if not a toast message appears to let the user know that time interval is missing. This is done using the following lines of code,</p>

</pre></div>



<p>Once the user sets the time interval and selects the parameters, the following lines of code generates a string array containing params selected by the user. </p>

<p>After we have the list of selected parameters we call the following function to create the config file</p>

<p>In the first part of this function, we check whether there exists a PSLab directory in the local storage of the device, if not the directory is created. After that, we create a file named “pslab_config.txt”. After that, we use FileWriter to write data to the file. </p>



<p>In a nutshell with this feature user can create config files easily. The following GIF demonstrated this functionality.</p>

<p>This blog post explains the requirements &amp; implementation details of a secure route over which the tickets could be served in the Open Event Project (Eventyay). <a href="https://eventyay.com">Eventyay</a> is the Open Event management solution using standardized event formats developed at FOSSASIA. Sometimes, tickets of a user can be utilized in the process of fraudulent actions. To prevent this, security is of the utmost importance.</p>



<p>Prior to this feature, anonymous/unauthorized users were able to access the tickets which belonged to another user with a simple link. There was no provision of any authentication check.&nbsp; An additional problem with the tickets were the storage methodology where the tickets were stored in a top-level folder which was not protected. Therefore, there was a necessity to implement a flask route which could check if the user was authenticated, the ticket belonged to the authorized user/admin/organizer of the event and provide proper exceptions in other cases.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/b_mHhXpAufYDWurqqSeCro3jcFGjE1-LPo2SaiTJA7q5h_RU79BVg7w9LD1_81SgCSChi-T7_JrZuneMpx0T-OJGmjEG_1hLndnhurz71okmXpAD4Vuuw0PA4AmoltykgcyN2c8n" alt="" /></figure>



<p style="text-align:center">		<em>	</em><em>Ticket completion page with option to download tickets</em><br></p>



<p>When the user places an order and it goes through successfully,the ticket is generated, stored in a protected folder and the user is redirected to the order completion page where they would be able to download their tickets. When the user clicks on the <em>Download Tickets</em> Button, the <em>ticket_blueprint</em> route is triggered. </p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tickets_route &#8211; the logic pertaining to security module for attendee tickets</em>				<br></p>



<p>The function associated with the ticket downloads queries the Order model using the order identifier as a key. Then, it checks if the current authenticated user is either a staff member, the owner of the ticket or the organizer of the ticket. If it passes this check, the file path is generated and tickets are downloaded using the <em>return_tickets</em> function.</p>



<p>In the <em>return_tickets </em>function, we utilize the send_file function imported from Flask and wrap it with flask’s <em>make_response </em>function. In addition to that, we attach headers to specify that it is an attachment and add an appropriate name to it.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><pre class="hljs" style="padding: 0.5em"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">def</span> <span class="hljs-title" style="font-weight: 700">return_file</span><span class="hljs-params">(file_name_prefix, file_path, identifier)</span>:</span>
    response = make_response(send_file(file_path))
    response.headers[<span class="hljs-string">'Content-Disposition'</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">'attachment; filename=%s-%s.pdf'</span> % (file_name_prefix, identifier)
    <span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">return</span> response</pre></pre>



<p style="text-align:center"><em>return_tickets function &#8211; sends the file as a make_response with appropriate headers</em>				<br></p>



<p>When it comes to exception handling, at each stage whenever a ticket is not to be found while querying or the authentication check fails, a proper exception is thrown to the user. For example, at the step where an attempt is made to return the file using file path after authentication, if the tickets are NotFound, the tickets are generated on the fly.&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><pre class="hljs" style="padding: 0.5em"> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword" style="font-weight: 700">def</span> <span class="hljs-title" style="font-weight: 700">can_download_tickets</span><span class="hljs-params">(self, order)</span>:</span>

We are now just nearing the end of Google Summer of Code but we still would like to properly introduce you to this year&#8217;s class of interns &#8211; GSOC is now in its 15th year and Mifos has the honor of participating for the sixth time independently and eighth year overall. Once again this is our biggest year to date with a total of 14 interns participating in GSOC directly through the Mifos Initiative. In this post we&#8217;re also going to introduce you to two GSOC interns that are being mentored through the Apache Software Foundation as well as two Outreachy interns sponsored by DIAL and the Outreachy General Fund working on documentation projects.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">We have six interns working on mobile apps, three interns working on web apps, six interns working on new modules or the back-end for Fineract, one intern working on Fineract CN, and two Outreachy interns working on migrating our mailing list to Discourse and converting our user manual to a Gitbook. Stay tuned for some upcoming webinars in which our interns will be showcasing their work to our community and Part 2 of this blog post giving a personal look into each of interns. </p>

<p>For our suite of Mifos Mobile Apps on Fineract and Fineract CN, we have six students continuing to extend them. Moksh Mahajan, under the mentorship of Tarun Mudgal, will be extending our Android Field Operations App to Version 6.0. Prashant Khandelwal is working Mifos Mobile 4.0, our mobile banking app, Shivansh Tiwari is working on Version of our Mobile Wallet, Saksham Handu, under the mentorship of Rajan Maurya, is working on Version 3.0 of Fineract CN Mobile while Abhijit Ramesh is working on Version 2.0 of Mifos Mobile CN. Lastly Manish Kumar is contributing to FiinWallet &#8211; a hybrid mobile wallet/banking app contributed by Fintecheando. </p>
<p>On the front-end, both Jivjyot Singh and Abhay Chawla are working completing the rewrite of the Mifos X web app into Angular 7 while Cajetan Rodrigues is working on Version 3.0 of the Online Banking app.</p>
<p>On the back-end for Fineract, we&#8217;re looking to wrap up some eagerly awaited projects and release some new Mifos X innovation, Sidhant Gupta is using the recently created Payment Hub to integrate with the GSMA mobile money API. Apporva MK is experimenting with some bleeding edge technology by building out a tool to collect the PPI by only taking images and using the Computer Vision APIs and machine learning to detect objects in those imagesk. Anshul Singth is refining the Mifos chatbot and helping to make it production-ready &#8211; Likewise, Supreeth S Karan, is continuing our machine learning project development a scorecard from credit risk assessment. Last but not least, Dylan Robson is hardening and strengthening Fineract and Mifos X by fixing some long outstanding bugs and feature request from our backlog. </p>
<p>Under the umbrella of the Apache Software Foundation, on Fineract CN, Ebenezer Graham, is continuing his contributions working to remove Category X dependencies. Kang Brader is updating and making production-ready our Swagger APIs.</p>
<p>Participating in Outreachy with the support of DIAL, we have two interns from Cameroon working on documentation and collaborative projects &#8211; Massabe Lydian Kengne is converting our user manual to Gitbook format and Kerlyn Manyi is migrating our old Mifos mailing lists and Google Groups to a highly collaborative Discourse forum.</p>

        <p><em>The Mifos Initiative had the honor of being at OSCON hosting a booth in the non-profit pavilion of the Expo Hall for the ninth year this past month in Portland, OR. We also were able to continue telling our transformative story around Open Source Core Banking through a talk on the Business Summit given by Edward Cable, on <a href="https://youtu.be/420opnxxhmw">Democratizing Financial Services</a> and how Open Source Core Banking is enabling a multiplier effect. As we&#8217;ve done in the past, we like to share the firsthand experience of our Business Development intern at their first OSCON &#8211; read on below for a glimpse into Jackson Reed&#8217;s first time at OSCON. </em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple weeks ago, I attended my first ever OSCON. At first I was overwhelmed by the giant displays companies like AWS, Salesforce and IBM had to offer. I was also intrigued by how these companies are involved in the Open Source Community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190717_112821.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7396" src="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190717_112821.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190717_112821.jpg 4032w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190717_112821-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190717_112821-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190717_112821-1500x1125.jpg 1500w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190717_112821-705x529.jpg 705w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190717_112821-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My role at the convention centered on building awareness of our initiative at our booth in the  Exposition Hall with companies small to large and profit and non-profit companies. Throughout the morning and into the afternoon, there were speakers from all the organizations present. Even Mifos’ very own President/ CEO Ed Cable gave a talk on how to  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://youtu.be/420opnxxhmw">Democratize Fintech and Enable Financial Services through Open Source Banking</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As just an incoming Junior at the University of Washington, some of the keynotes and talks really grew my understanding of Open Source and what individuals are doing within the space. I vividly remember Brad Topol and Pedro Cruz speaking about how IBM is using Open Source to mitigate Natural Disasters. By using AI through drones, they are able to help detect visuals that may be people drawing SOS signals on the ground, and the drones find those when flying over disaster areas.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7394" src="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190716_220019.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190716_220019.jpg 4032w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190716_220019-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190716_220019-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190716_220019-1500x1125.jpg 1500w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190716_220019-705x529.jpg 705w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190716_220019-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, Russell Rutledge from Nike spoke on how to grow an organization into an Open Collaboration Model in order to scale it. By working more openly and together, a company is able to grow more and be successful. This is something I can take into my daily life as well, collaboration is key to success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most interesting talks I attended was how to use Planning Poker to make business decisions. The Concept allows individuals to make private estimations on how long a project will take, then using collaboration to define those estimations to more precise estimates. Laura Janusek from Modern Teacher made the talk hands-on and collaborative as we participated in live estimations. This concept of private estimations that lead to collaboration and more precise estimates is a very valuable tool. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190718_134552.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7393" src="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190718_134552.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190718_134552.jpg 4032w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190718_134552-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190718_134552-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190718_134552-1500x1125.jpg 1500w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190718_134552-705x529.jpg 705w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190718_134552-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the talks, it was great to interact at various booths on the convention floor. Whether it be interacting with their software, just learning about their company, getting free swag, and yes signing up for giveaways (Ed and I, both left OSCON winners of Giveaways). Additionally, interacting with individuals at Mifos’ booth was great. We were able to spread the word and mission about the initiative. Many people had never heard before how Financial Inclusivity and Banking could be in the Open Source community. We were able to garner a lot of interest about the Initiative and hopefully brought more people into the Mifos Community.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, OSCON was a great experience. By interacting with professionals in the Open Source community, I grew professionally. By attending countless talks and keynotes, I learned how Open Source impacts various people all over the world, and how to resource as best as possible. </span></p>

      <i class="author">Edward Cable</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m pleased to announce the ongoing collaboration between the Mifos Initiative and the Mojaloop community being funded by a <a href="https://www.osc.dial.community/stratagrant.html">strategic grant</a> from </span><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/what-we-do/dial-open-source-center/">DIAL (Digital Impact Alliance),</a> and their Open Source Center. With the funding from DIAL, we’re embarking on the first step in our vision to create an end to end open source architecture for digital financial services, integrating Mifos and <a href="http://mojaloop.io/">Mojaloop</a>. Mojaloop provides the digital payment rails and Mifos provides the account management engine fueling innovation on top of them. Working with the team at <a href="https://dpc.hu/">DPC Consulting</a> in Hungary, we have created a Mifos lab which provides a live environment for digital payment transactions to flow through a Mojaloop switch, initiated from accounts held at Digital Financial Service Providers (DFSPs) running Fineract and Fineract CN as their account management system. We had the honor and pleasure of joining the Mojaloop community and demoing this at the recent community convening in Arusha, Tanzania.</p>

Post the convening, the tremendous momentum continued with a number of announcements centered around Mojaloop adoption across all segments of the financial services sector.  The </span><a href="https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/BoT-launches-single-payment-system/1840340-4981752-d3ybfbz/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Bank of the Republic of Tanzania announced the development of TIPS, the Tanzania Instant Payment System</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, of which they’ve chosen to adopt Mojaloop as the basis for their same-as-cash electronic payment system. </span><a href="http://www.woccu.org/newsroom/releases/WOCCU_pursues_digital_financial_inclusion_for_50_million-plus_people_across_Asia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WOCCU announced its digital financial inclusion strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach 50 million-plus people across Asia centered around  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a project to design interoperable, open-loop, low-cost, real-time payment platforms for its global network of credit unions across Asia, exploring the use of the </span><a href="http://mojaloop.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mojaloop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> open-source platform. Great progress is being made with the </span><a href="https://www.orange.com/en/Press-Room/press-releases/press-releases-2018/Orange-and-MTN-launch-pan-African-mobile-money-interoperability-to-scale-up-mobile-financial-services-across-Africa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launch of Mowali</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the mobile wallet interoperability initiative powered by Mojaloop, and led by Orange and MTN to enable interoperable payments across all of Africa. The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dfs-lab-announces-open-applications-for-fintech-hackathon-focused-on-the-mojaloop-software-300787769.html">DFS Lab Mojaloop Hackathon</a> in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, in mid-April is fast-approaching and will give fintech companies an opportunity to develop and test innovative use cases on Mojaloop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mifos Initiative looks forward to being an enabling factor in not only extending the functionality of Mojaloop and evangelizing the platform but most importantly enabling and accelerating adoption by providing a robust lab environment and a Mojaloop-ready open source toolkit of account management systems, mobile wallets and a payment hub to facilitate the smooth integration with the Mojaloop APIs. Our vision is to provide the account and wallet management capabilities for an institution that wants to connect to Mojaloop whether they’re a SACCO or MFI, a fintech company, a mobile wallet provider, or even a bank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to DIAL for enabling this collaboration, the DPC team for their stellar work, the Gates Foundation for enabling our participation at the convening and the Mojaloop community and ModusBox team for all their support with the integration. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-7298"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Mojaloop?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Kleinbaum and our friends at the DFS Lab provide </span><a href="https://medium.com/dfs-lab/what-the-fintech-a-primer-on-mojaloop-50ae1c0ccafb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a nice primer on Mojaloop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To quote Dan,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In its simplest form, Mojaloop is a payment switch built in open source code. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aim of </span><a href="http://mojaloop.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mojaloop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an open source project being spearheaded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is to create interoperable, low-cost payment systems that allow everyone, especially the poor, to access financial services. Mojaloop aims to accomplish this by using open source software and implementing a clever payment system design that was purpose built for emerging market environments and low value transactions. The principles behind Mojaloop are articulated in the L1P (<a href="https://leveloneproject.org/">Level One Project</a>). Mojaloop is the open source software project that implements the <a href="https://leveloneproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/L1P_Level-One-Principles-and-Perspective.pdf">L1P principles</a> and system design.” </span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Mifos and Mojaloop?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mifos and Mojaloop are two highly complementary open source systems that make a perfect fit. </span></p>
<p>Mifos/Fineract is a full stack core banking and account management platform that serves as the DFSP system needed to connect into a payment scheme that’s powered by Mojaloop. Our Mifos Lab will use Mojaloop as the &#8220;switch&#8221; between multiple Fineract/Mifos instances in various configurations such as a digital retail bank, an MFI, a SACCO or cooperative, or a mobile wallet provider.</p>
<p>Think of Mifos/Fineract as the DNA of financial services that can be put together in many expressions coupled with Mojaloop as the connective payment tissue enabling interoperability of payments. Any financial service or even any transaction-based product linked to an account or wallet can be designed, created, and scaled effectively and efficiently.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the Vision for the Mifos Lab? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Mifos Lab goes well beyond simply the simulation of an end to end environment demonstrating transactions flowing via Mojaloop between different DFSP systems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It showcases in a tangible way how the Mojaloop APIs work via rich mobile and web interfaces</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It champions best practices for implementing, deploying and developing open source payment and core banking solutions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides an actionable open source toolkits of production-ready DFS solutions that can be implemented or extended.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It harnesses a collaborative community to share knowledge and ideas</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s backed by a global ecosystem of system integrators and fintechs that is ready to deploy and extend Mojaloop</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mifos and the Fineract core banking infrastructure has a key role to play in the emergence of payment systems guided by the level one principles. We can provide cost-effective account and mobile wallet management and with core banking built-in we can enable the quick rollout of adjacencies &#8211; loan and savings products on top of these digital payment systems.</span></p>
<p>Key to our support from DIAL is our shared vision for the potential of Mifos and Mojaloop to become the payments backbone for the entire development sector. Innovation doesn’t stop at traditional financial inclusion or even digital financial services as whole. Any service delivered via an account or wallet or any payment/transaction that could be digitized will benefit from this integration &#8211; agricultural, clean energy (PAYG), healthcare, and education sector and more.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the presentation we gave in Tanzania at the convening:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Progress to Date</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tanzania, we did a live demo of the proximity-based merchant payment use case by allowing a merchant with an account in Fineract CN to generate a dynamic QR Code with the payee info and the amount encoded in the URI-format. A customer with an account in Fineract CN then used a mobile app with a QR code scanner to scan the QR code and approve the payment with all funds getting transferred to and from the Fineract CN accounts via the Mojaloop APIs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve completed that use case and use case for a peer to peer push transfer. We await the remaining APIs for bulk transfer and merchant request to pay before completing those use cases. DPC designed and implemented a payment hub middleware which sits in between the core banking system and Mojaloop, abstracting the complexity of integrating with the Mojaloop APIs.  The payment hub, and the integration with Mojaloop and Fineract APIs, has all been deployed in a containerized environment on AWS with two instances of Fineract and two instances of Fineract CN running. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-11.13.50-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7300" src="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-11.13.50-AM.png" alt="" width="639" height="354" srcset="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-11.13.50-AM.png 639w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-11.13.50-AM-300x166.png 300w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-11.13.50-AM-450x249.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The payment hub code is now available on <a href="https://github.com/openMF/payment-hub">GitHub</a> and the requisite changes to Fineract and Fineract CN are ready to be discussed and reviewed before merging in. Read over the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iVTgqljj5jW1eczpUcN_qykvWGh9bPKalxDayW8ZGcU/edit?usp=sharing">documentation on the design</a> and how to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnAuWxmX-Fof7-o69IyU9ilwcmigqQ6dNHc9uNRx1r4/edit?usp=sharing">implement the Payment Hub</a> and Mojaloop integration. </span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll soon be publishing a roadmap for the payment hub and Mojaloop integration so others in the community can get involved.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are pleased to support the Mifos Initiative &#8211; a leader in financial inclusion and microfinance technology &#8211; in their mission to enable financial institutions to bring responsible financial services to the over 3 billion people who are without effective access today,&#8221; stated Feyzi Fatehi, CEO of Corent Technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a bold mission, serving potentially thousands of smaller financial institutions, requires a SaaS solution that is highly automated and scalable and that can be easily deployed, efficiently delivered and affordably managed. By powering the Mifos X Platform with the SaaS-enablement capabilities of SurPaaS, we are pleased to be a part of empowering this global initiative,&#8221; added Fatehi.<span id="more-7283"></span></p>
<p>Built around a modern API-centric architecture, Mifos X Platform for Financial Inclusion is a modern, connected core banking system for responsible financial services organizations who are bringing basic financial services to the poor and developing markets globally. It is highly extensible, easy-to-integrate with third-party systems and payments networks. Client organizations include microfinance institutions and microfinance banks, and increasingly savings organizations and credit cooperatives. The Mifos software is typically deployed by in-country partners who build commercial service offerings to support multiple institutions. Hundreds of small financial institutions already benefit from having access to the software.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to team up with Corent and value their support of this global initiative. Corent provides the ability to efficiently deliver Mifos X as SaaS, enabling our partners around the world to offer our platform in a much more cost-effective manner, and opening up new opportunities for our customers,” said Ed Cable, President &amp; CEO of Mifos Initiative.</p>
<p>Corent’s SurPaaS® platform provides Mifos with the operations, optimization and commercial capabilities to deliver the Mifos X application as an efficient, scalable SaaS (Software as a Service) offering. Now Mifos partner organizations can offer the open source Mifos X application as fully managed SaaS in a dramatically more efficient and cost-effective way. By using Corent’s SurPaaS® these partners can become SaaS Providers rather than simply hosters of Mifos X. Utilizing the new SaaS-enabled Mifos X, partners now easily and efficiently can go to market addressing additional segments and customers.</p>
<p>SurPaaS® provides all of the Tenancy, Operations and Commercial management capabilities required for a scalable SaaS application, allowing the Mifos community to focus on their core mission of developing and supporting financial inclusion for all.</p>
<p>This project is a part of Corent’s broader OpenSaaS<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Initiative that is opening new possibilities for enterprise oriented open source applications by enabling them to be delivered as SaaS from the cloud, with all the efficiency that the SaaS delivery model has to offer – without any programming. The OpenSaaS<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> initiative mission is to bring the benefits of the SaaS model to the open source community at large.</p>
<p>“We at Corent are proud to be a partner and supporter of Mifos Initiative’s great mission and community around the globe,&#8221; said Fatehi.</p>

<p>Over the past few months our Social Impact team has been busy carrying out <a href="https://www.yoti.com/blog/tag/research/">research</a> across Africa, South East Asia and the United Kingdom to better understand digital identity needs and opportunities in these locations. We’ve been speaking to experts around the world and attending digital identity and humanitarian events to get a sense of who is doing what, where. Our findings have led to the development of an exciting user-focused, evidence-based Social Impact Strategy which we are proud to be launching today, along with an <a href="https://www.yoti.com/impact/">updated section of the Yoti website</a>.<span id="more-7267"></span></p>
<p>The primary focus of much of the digital identity sector is on the design, adoption and use of large-scale digital identity systems and how users interact with them. This includes national efforts, such as the Aadhaar ID system in India. Most of this research begins with the technology and works its way down to the people who use it, an approach which has given us something of a knowledge deficit.</p>
<p>What we’re missing is an understanding of why people might want a digital identity, how they interpret or understand digital identity, their concerns and what tools and approaches might be missing in their local context.</p>
<p><strong>While we know there are approximately 1.1 billion people around the world who would benefit from some form of (likely digital) identity, we know far less about their own personal motivations for wanting and using one. And without a fuller understanding of these kind of bottom-up issues, we have little chance of developing the most useful and appropriate solutions. We need to dive deeper and find out more if we want to increase our chances of adopting the right kind of identity – a <a href="https://www.good-id.org/en/">Good Identity</a> – in our sector.</strong></p>
<p>While we remain committed to helping solve the problem of the 1.1 billion, our new Social Impact Strategy is designed to help us better understand digital (and broader 21st century) identity perceptions, motivations, challenges, opportunities and concerns among grassroots communities and migrants around the world.</p>
<p>With a particular focus on emerging markets, the Strategy is made up of a number of key activities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping local researchers and policy makers to better understand the opportunities and issues through our exciting new annual Fellowship Program, launching in the next few weeks.</li>
<li>Empowering local innovators and thought leaders by providing a support program for developing world innovation hubs, universities and business centres.</li>
<li>Running competitions and challenges in support of local innovation efforts.</li>
<li>Providing an open-source digital identity solution that is simple to use, free and completely offline. This has been designed specifically for grassroots, last-mile nonprofits and socially-focussed groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Strategy has one key purpose: to help further the positive social impact of digital identity solutions globally and to ensure digital identity becomes a force for good – for everyone, everywhere.</p>

<h3>Abhay&#8217;s Impact:</h3>
<p><strong>Discovering Mifos</strong><strong style="font-size: 12px;"><em>:</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I first came to know about Mifos in 2017 when my senior Dilpreet Singh got selected for Google Summer of Code. Mifos Initiative’s mission to provide a platform for every individual so that they can have access to financial services to create a better tomorrow for themselves, really motivated me to become a part of the organisation. While looking for projects to contribute, I found out about various AngularJS based projects, a framework that I was learning about at that time. Thus, I decided to begin contributing to open source by solving the issues in the community-app.</span></p>
<p><strong>Contributions Made to Date: </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started the work on revamping the community-app into the new web-app along with the integrated self service administrative portal based on Angular 6 and material design as part of my Google Summer of Code in 2018. Apart from that, I have contributed to solving various issues in the community-app and the web-self-service-app. As a mentor of Google Code-in, I created and reviewed various tasks related to coding, design and documentation of the web-app with Digital Impact Alliance under the guidance of Mifos.</span></p>
<p><strong>Current Projects: </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently I have been continuing my work on the web-app, at the same time engaging new contributors to help complete this revamped version and integrate some new features including the self service administrative portal and app configuration so that it can be released to the community soon.</span></p>
<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0.6em 0px 1.2em 0px;"><strong>Impact on the Poor: </strong></p>
<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0.6em 0px 1.2em 0px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope to keep contributing to the communities that strive to make the lives of the poor better by making technology more accessible and developing applications that are easy to use for all.</span></p>
<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0.6em 0px 1.2em 0px;"><strong>What&#8217;s Rewarding about Working on Mifos:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting to interact with the community members and the mentors has been the most rewarding experience for me. Throughout the GSoC period I got an opportunity to not only work on the new revamped version of the web-app improving my knowledge about material design and Angular but also be a part of the decision making process and learn from everyone. I am thankful to them for believing in me.</span></p>
<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0.6em 0px 1.2em 0px;"><strong>Top Piece of Advice for Others in the Mifos Community:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d advice other students/interns and members to always be active in the community and never hesitate to get help or clarifications from others when stuck. Make the best use of all the communication channels (mailing list/slack/gitter) and help each other as well, whenever possible. Make sure to write documentation/comments for the code you have contributed to in a project. It will not only be helpful for the newcomers but for you as well in the future.</span></p>

      <h5>2018-12-28T01:09:53.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Edward Cable</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As 2018 comes to a close, it’s time to look back on the year that was. The growth of our ecosystem, both in scale of outreach and breadth of services and solutions continues to impress us &#8211; more than 10,000,000 individuals are now being reached by solutions powered by Mifos and Fineract! We finally began to tell that story on a grander stage, getting the word out at multiple conferences and getting recognized for different awards. While we didn’t ship many official releases, we&#8217;re ready to release the newest versions of our mobile wallet and mobile banking apps, the next release of Mifos X and are ready to jumpstart the community around Fineract CN.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we heads toward 2019, we look to our vibrant ecosystem to help us take the Mifos Initiative to new heights &#8211; we’ll be working directly with partners to catalyze new solutions, we&#8217;ll be launching an association-based funding model to directly enable partners and users to help with ongoing sustainability, and we’ll begin executing upon our roadmap for Fineract CN, unlocking our vision of Financial Inclusion 2.0.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s our list of the top 10 moments from 2018 in more or less chronological order.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7164"></span></p>
<h3><b>Fueling our Vision for Fineract CN with Fintech Advisors like Vincent Alimi</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vincent-Alimi.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-6597 size-square" src="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vincent-Alimi-180x180.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="180" srcset="https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vincent-Alimi-180x180.jpg 180w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vincent-Alimi-80x80.jpg 80w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vincent-Alimi-300x300.jpg 300w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vincent-Alimi-36x36.jpg 36w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vincent-Alimi-120x120.jpg 120w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vincent-Alimi-450x450.jpg 450w, https://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vincent-Alimi.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February <a href="https://mifos.org/blog/fintech-advisor-vincent-alimi/">we officially welcomed Vincent Alimi as one of our Fintech Advisors</a>. Despite his busy day job at a Montreal fintech startup, Vincent has made time to help scale technology-enabled financial inclusion by helping us formulate strategic partnerships in the payment space and crystallize our vision for digital financial services. With the first institutions starting to pilot Fineract CN in 2018, our advisors and stakeholders are helping us shape a roadmap for Fineract CN to help build out solutions to support all financial inclusion and fintech verticals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are eager to grow our base of advisors in 2019 &#8211; so if you are experienced in fintech, financial inclusion, open source, community development, fundraising, non-profit governance, or full stack development, we’d love to welcome you as an advisor to assist the initiative and ecosystem.</span></p>
<h3><b>Honoring our Star Contributors</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not encapsulated in a singular moment in 2018, we couldn’t have made all the progress on Fineract, Fineract CN, and our Mifos X suite of apps without the tireless contributions of our volunteers &#8211; we recognized five star contributors in 2018 &#8211; <a href="https://mifos.org/blog/star-contributor-sanyam-goel/">Sanyam Goel</a>, <a href="https://mifos.org/blog/star-contributor-steve-conrad/">Steve Conrad</a>, <a href="https://mifos.org/blog/star-contributor-of-the-month-sundari-swami/">Sundari Swami</a>, <a href="https://mifos.org/blog/star-contributor-aleks-vidakovic/">Aleks Vidakovic</a>, and <a href="https://mifos.org/blog/star-contributor-chirag-gupta/">Chirag Gupta</a>.

<h3><b>Transform Africa Summit 2018</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally invited to attend the <a href="http://smartafrica.org/events/past-meetings-and-events/article/transform-africa-summit-2018-07-10-may-2018-kigali-rwanda">2018 Transform Africa Summit</a> in Kigali, Rwanda hosted by Smart Africa, it was astounding to be a part of the impressive gathering of technologists and diplomats gathered together to advance the theme of “Accelerating Africa’s Single Digital Market”. Especially noteworthy were the vibrant sessions on open government and blockchain adoption that were part of the launch of the Transform Africa Economic Forum which focused </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on harnessing the power of digital technologies in accelerating the pace towards achieving the goals of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area.</span></p>
<p>While in East Africa, I also had the chance to re-connect with active Mifos partners, hewe and GoIT Solutions, onboard new partner, Fintexx, and promote our Financial Inclusion 2.0 initiative to FSD Kenya, MasterCard Labs, and MicroSave.</p>

<h3><b>Google Summer of Code &#8211; our Largest Intern Class Yet</b></h3>

<h3>Announcing our Moonshot at OSCON and ApacheCon</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had the honor and privilege of being speakers at both OSCON in Portland and ApacheCon in Montreal. We planted our flag and told the world about our moonshot to disrupt the fintech sector with Open Source Core Banking from the ground up through our talk, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open banking: Fueling innovation on an open source core banking platform. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We showed the transformative power of building scalable solutions on top of our open APIs by bighlighting several enterprise case studies of institutions from our ecosystem ranging from fintech startups in India and Africa to the largest microfinance bank in Latin America, all the way up to formal banks in Western Europe.</span></p>
